| **`pcc_eng_10_019.2527_x0295016_57:5-6-7`**     | The two situations are n't __``remotely comparable``__ , and in fact I think they differ in at least six key ways :                                                                                                                         |
| **`apw_eng_19980204_0856_30:6-7-8`**            | note that we could accomplish nothing __``remotely comparable``__ on the basis of the Court\/rebel scenes .                                                                                                                                 |
| **`pcc_eng_27_056.5249_x0897571_130:10-11-12`** | So , I think that those two situations are not __``remotely comparable``__ , in terms of the harm that Ellsberg did to the country , which I think was trivial , relative to what Snowden has done , which arguably is far more serious .   |
| **`pcc_eng_06_076.1177_x1214896_30:7-8`**       | I challenge anyone to find a __``remotely comparable``__ example from any other studio in film history .                                                                                                                                    |

| **`pcc_eng_19_015.8839_x0240157_042:8-9`**      | If , like the other drugs of __``remotely comparable``__ power , mescalin were notoriously toxic , the taking of it would be enough , of itself , to cause anxiety .                                                                        |
| **`pcc_eng_13_011.8378_x0174845_18:30-31`**     | The uncomfortable reality is that we live in a society where sexual harassment and sexual violence against women is accepted and condoned to a far greater extent than any __``remotely comparable``__ violence against men .               |
| **`pcc_eng_05_087.5005_x1399656_41:16-18-19`**  | It 's a mistake to equate elections with private-sector performance reviews , because they 're not even __``remotely comparable``__ .                                                                                                       |
