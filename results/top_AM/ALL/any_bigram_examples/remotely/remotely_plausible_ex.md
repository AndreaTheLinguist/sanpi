| **`pcc_eng_03_006.6967_x0092135_160:3-5-6`** | It is n't even __`remotely plausible`__ to suggest that inequality is simply happening by some kind of accident .                                                                                                                     |
| **`pcc_eng_10_031.6528_x0495648_25:14-15`**  | Chris may be right that they will say this , but is it __`remotely plausible`__ ?                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`pcc_eng_16_025.3532_x0394188_177:16-17`** | No , it 's " ugh " because whatever it takes to make this couple __`remotely plausible`__ , let alone palatable , neither the stars , nor screenwriter Alex Gottlieb , nor director Frank Tashlin have it .                           |
| **`pcc_eng_05_076.7632_x1226239_178:09-10`** | Which reminds me , how was it even __`remotely plausible`__ that Sally Yates was convinced that Mike Flynn was compromised because he had n't been completely forthright in disclosing his conversation with the Russian ambassador ? |
| **`pcc_eng_29_048.3466_x0764599_28:13-14`**  | To the author 's credit they figured out that to sound even __`remotely plausible`__ and still make me wet my Underoos over the advanced technology featured in the book , one had to open with a year further out than 2000 A.D .    |
| **`pcc_eng_10_033.6088_x0527367_25:15-16`**  | Yet there is something puzzling about Trump 's failure to come up with a __`remotely plausible`__ infrastructure plan .                                                                                                               |
| **`pcc_eng_26_100.6587_x1611112_70:8-9`**    | For whatever reason , that only seems __`remotely plausible`__ and even somehow adorable in the context of that franchise .                                                                                                           |
| **`pcc_eng_val_1.8183_x13288_11:19-20`**     | The bad news is that much of The Joker 's appeal -- and all of what makes him __`remotely plausible`__ -- is that nobody is sure who or what he is .                                                                                  |
