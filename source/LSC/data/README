The LSC model is a soft-clustering model for n-tuples of words,
e.g. for verb-object pairs or for verb-preposition-noun triples. The
model is described in a paper by Mats Rooth entitled "Two-dimensional
clusters in grammatical relations" which is available at
http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/~mats

The LSC model is trained with the following command

> lsc-train 20 50 vo.txt > m-20-50

The first argument is the number of clusters.
The second argument is the number of EM training iterations.
The third argument is the name of the file with the training data.

The first line of the data file contains the number of elements in
each tuple (2 for pairs, 3 for triples etc.) Each of the following
lines contains one data item consisting of the tuple frequency and
the words of the data tuple. Tabs are used as field separators.

The LSC model is stored as a binary file. The following command will
print it in readable form:
> lsc-print -n 10 m-20-50 > m-20-50.txt

The program lsc-disambiguate can be used to evaluate the model on a
pseudo disambiguation task.

> lsc-disambiguate m-20-50 vo-test.txt
