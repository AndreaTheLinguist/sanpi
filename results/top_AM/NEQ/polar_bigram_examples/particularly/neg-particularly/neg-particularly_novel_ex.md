| **`pcc_eng_00_036.7442_x0577427_070:11-12-13`** | The audience went nuts and got two fitting , if not __``particularly novel``__ ( or energizing ) , Schumann ( ? ) encores .                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`pcc_eng_03_085.6512_x1370701_05:17-18-19`**  | In a city where five-star restaurants are tucked away in nondescript strip malls , there 's nothing __``particularly novel``__ about a high / low culinary mash- up .                                                                                                                         |
| **`pcc_eng_10_049.5724_x0785567_29:6-7-8`**     | In truth , there 's nothing __``particularly novel``__ or disquieting about the scheme Murray 's drawn up , except insofar as the procedural extremism conservatives have deployed in the Obama era is alarming in general .                                                                  |
| **`pcc_eng_25_033.1210_x0519960_021:3-4-5`**    | There 's nothing __``particularly novel``__ about utilizing targeted and sometimes conflicting messages to different audiences , but it would be nice if GOPers stopped squealing like little piggies every time they get called on it , and projecting their dishonesty onto everyone else . |
| **`pcc_eng_20_088.9868_x1421466_013:27-28-29`** | For example , though it is great to see the mainstream media come to condemn the intellectual fallacies inherent with protectionist trade policies , there is nothing __``particularly novel``__ about a president imposing tariffs .                                                         |
| **`pcc_eng_22_002.3096_x0021261_63:6-7-8`**     | Of course , there is nothing __``particularly novel``__ about the relationship between reading and the " self " and its presentation .                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`pcc_eng_08_072.6067_x1159294_09:14-15-16`**  | The idea that ISPs might be interested in hosting cloud services is thus not __``particularly novel``__ , nor is it particularly hard for them to stand a cloud service up today .                                                                                                            |
| **`pcc_eng_27_106.1698_x1701274_23:24-25-26`**  | For a sense of what awaits , our seven courses began with a raw slice of hamachi and asparagus tips in ponzu - not __``particularly novel``__ , but a refreshing start .                                                                                                                      |
