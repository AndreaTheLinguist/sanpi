| **`pcc_eng_13_039.0067_x0614526_08:18-19-20`** | The premise of a group of film students shooting a clandestine porn film on the side is n't __``particularly original``__ , but it is handled with a genuine affection for its subject matter , and enough fresh angles that the overall script did n't feel as though it had all been done before . |
| **`pcc_eng_26_085.8858_x1372655_125:4-5-6`**   | I will say nothing __``particularly original``__ here , so feel free to whistle your own cheerful tune as you read this .                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **`pcc_eng_12_064.9497_x1033756_27:10-11-12`** | The European-esque architecture combined with a steampunk aesthetic is n't __``particularly original``__ , but combined with Kyo Ani 's level of care it becomes something truly captivating .                                                                                                       |
| **`pcc_eng_05_035.2847_x0555274_24:7-8-9`**    | On the downside the plot is n't __``particularly original``__ and it really is just a man shooting , jumping and punching things , but it is done so well that you must argue that it is one of the best we have seen recently .                                                                     |

| **`pcc_eng_26_030.2514_x0472632_70:5-6-7`**    | The main story is n't __``particularly original``__ , borrowing from everything from Thor to Spider - Man to even something like The Lion King .                                                                                                                                                     |
