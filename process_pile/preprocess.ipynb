      "As we traveled to Harrison, my seven-year-old mind seemed to record us being on some sort of mountainous hill. One road went to Harrison while another road seemed to lead to another town down in a distant valley. A look at a map reveals it might've been Omaha, Arkansas.\n",
      "\n",
      "To this day, 32 years later, I still wonder about that town. What was its name? What secrets did it hold? What stories did it tell? Or, did it exist solely in my imagination?\n",

      "I have resurrected and transported the town approximately 800 miles southwest into West Texas in a short story I am working on, titled Garth, Texas. In this lengthy, in-progress short story, a road goes up a hill, reaching a zenith; what lies on the road beyond the zenith is completely unknown to anyone seeing the road from the main road it bisects.\n",

Nothing is more agonizing than writer's block.\n",

      "Let me take stock. I have a novel and several short stories in the production stage. Currently, I'm about two-thirds done on my rough draft of The Game Show and am about a third into my short story whose name I'd rather not divulge. Both are suspenseful thrillers with characters that seem alive and well.\n",

      "In my short story, for instance, a man stumbles upon a town that's not on the map in West Texas and learns, much to his dismay, the locals already know who he is and want to punish him for past deeds. What happens next is something I can't quite figure out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Same for the book about a game show where more meets the eye. And, of course, same for the short story about the astronomer who discovers a strange planet and a long short story about a man who buys a gorgeous house at way below its appraised price.\n",
