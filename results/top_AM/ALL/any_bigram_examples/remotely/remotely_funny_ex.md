| **`pcc_eng_15_093.7738_x1499594_21:16-18-19`** | JP ( John Paul Temple ) is good like that , annoying as hell and not even __`remotely funny`__ , he is an excellent PT though .                                                                                                                                          |
| **`pcc_eng_20_030.2939_x0473614_15:1-2-3`**    | Not __`remotely funny`__ .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **`pcc_eng_08_049.8663_x0790906_25:37-39-40`** | You may also ponder the degree of nepotism involved with casting Catherine Reitman , the daughter of producer Ivan Retiman , as Ryden 's arch-rival Jessica , as she gives a flat deep-voiced performance that 's never even __`remotely funny`__ .                      |
| **`pcc_eng_09_083.0771_x1327763_75:19-21-22`** | But suddenly , now that I 'm not saying what they want to hear politically , I 'm not even __`REMOTELY funny`__ .                                                                                                                                                        |
| **`pcc_eng_15_025.8675_x0401865_07:16-17`**    | Giving me even more impetus to subject myself to a movie that may be only __`remotely funny`__ is news today that professional Mexican wrestler , Hijo del Santo ( " Son of the Saint " ) , is laying an eco-smackdown on the Pacific coastline .                        |
| **`pcc_eng_25_034.2862_x0538911_12:11-13-14`** | However , as Barnett points out , the label was n't " __`remotely funny`__ " -- if it had , she would have laughed .                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`pcc_eng_16_080.3288_x1283871_3:26-28-29`**  | because atleast to me it looks like she 's legitimately retarded and aside from a few errors with her japanese / pronounciation there 's absolutely nothing even __`remotely funny`__ , even for someone who ' gets ' what she is talking about .                        |
