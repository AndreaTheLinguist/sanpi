| **`pcc_eng_21_072.9718_x1163157_35:7-8`**    | However , the apertures of the __``longer focal``__ length lenses will have to be made slightly larger so that each will transmit the same amount of light to the negative .                                                                            |
| **`pcc_eng_21_009.7107_x0140613_20:7-8`**    | Unusually for me I used a __``longer focal``__ length lens to compress the perspective of the mountain ranges around me .                                                                                                                               |
| **`pcc_eng_00_102.8004_x1646532_185:27-28`** | On the other hand , in the scenes where we see more of his inner state of mind , or the minds of other characters , __``longer focal``__ lengths are used , putting all the focus on the eyes , or specific part of the character that is highlighted . |
| **`pcc_eng_24_033.3237_x0522911_09:6-7`**    | The turned edge has a __``longer focal``__ length than the rest of the mirror so the grating is further from the focal point of the edge .                                                                                                              |
| **`pcc_eng_19_062.6541_x0995296_7:17-18`**   | The Tele Vue Ethos is essentially multiple eyepieces , delivering the true field size of a __``longer focal``__ length , narrower apparent field eyepiece with the benefits of higher power and darker sky background .                                 |
| **`pcc_eng_27_103.4050_x1656674_31:12-13`**  | If blurry backgrounds are something you desire , you want a __``longer focal``__ length macro lens .                                                                                                                                                    |
| **`pcc_eng_00_102.8004_x1646532_290:2-3`**   | The __``longer focal``__ length does ask for a tripod , right focusing and enough light on the subject to make it of good quality .                                                                                                                     |
| **`pcc_eng_29_031.4666_x0491674_56:15-16`**  | A wider focal length reveals more reflections and repetition in the scene whereas a __``longer focal``__ length allows you to focus ( literally and compositionally ) on just a few reflections .                                                       |
