| **`pcc_eng_05_096.5764_x1546328_51:23-24`**     | All I did was extend , join OA with the light line and draw a line ( OA ' ) which is __``exactly perpendicular``__ to the first line OA and the same length .                                |
| **`pcc_eng_18_006.4208_x0087883_039:13-14-15`** | Note that there are still some perspective errors since the camera is not __``exactly perpendicular``__ to the direction of motion .                                                         |
| **`pcc_eng_12_003.4983_x0040384_03:20-21-22`**  | The legs are a tiny bit too short , so you have to put the switch in at a not __``exactly perpendicular``__ angle to the front panel .                                                       |
| **`pcc_eng_17_045.6612_x0721413_091:11-12`**    | The line of sight of the telescope needed to be __``exactly perpendicular``__ to the axis of rotation .                                                                                      |
| **`pcc_eng_28_047.0130_x0744575_22:16-17`**     | This is a bit more difficult since it is nearly impossible to take a photo __``exactly perpendicular``__ to the picture so the slight angle will create a small bit of distortion .          |
| **`pcc_eng_06_084.7837_x1354920_26:10-11`**     | ACTION : Lift your legs so that they are __``exactly perpendicular``__ from the floor .                                                                                                      |
| **`pcc_eng_02_057.6308_x0916136_20:11-12`**     | These characteristics include flatness of the nozzles and nozzle array __``exactly perpendicular``__ to the axis , an optical polish , and edges of nozzles chip free and slightly rounded . |
| **`pcc_eng_18_050.1124_x0795078_49:15-16`**     | This is where you can use the level to make sure the valet is __``exactly perpendicular``__ to the floor .                                                                                   |
