| **`pcc_eng_25_005.8437_x0078827_05:15-17-18`**  | After years of fish sticks , I was surprised to learn that this is not even __`remotely true`__ .                                                                                                                                    |
| **`pcc_eng_01_091.1640_x1457940_04:27-28-29`**  | But the reality is that the idea that there is a massive terror threat from " white supremacists , " dwarfing the jihad threat , is n't __`remotely true`__ .                                                                        |
| **`pcc_eng_25_005.6198_x0075235_09:09-11-12`**  | Not surprisingly , this turns out to be not even __`remotely true`__ .                                                                                                                                                               |
| **`pcc_eng_20_006.3181_x0085665_11:10-11-12`**  | This is a lovely sentiment , but it 's not __`remotely true`__ .                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`pcc_eng_08_107.4795_x1724114_012:02-17-18`** | That none of these claims ( with the arguable exception of the second ) is even __`remotely true`__ should n't be too surprising , because the " experts " who give voice to them typically define their expertise institutionally : |
| **`pcc_eng_26_008.0465_x0113678_033:13-15-16`** | In fact , not only is that inherently contradictory , it is not even __`remotely true`__ .                                                                                                                                           |
| **`pcc_eng_26_044.7963_x0708350_17:6-7-8`**     | A lot of it 's not __`remotely true`__ , so it 's kind of funny .                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **`pcc_eng_22_054.5010_x0864392_19:7-8-9`**     | In both cases , this is not __`remotely true`__ of the ' modern ' law enforced by corrupt and incompetent police and courts .                                                                                                        |
