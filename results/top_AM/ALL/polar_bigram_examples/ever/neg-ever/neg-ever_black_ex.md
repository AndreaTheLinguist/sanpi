| **`pcc_eng_17_040.7624_x0642478_03:15-17-18`** | It 's a slightly surreal video that I hope encapsulates my philosophy of ' Nothing is __``ever black``__ and white ' .                                                                                                              |
| **`pcc_eng_20_032.7412_x0513255_53:1-7-8`**    | Nothing in science or life is __``ever black``__ and white , and no matter superstition or scientific insight , the moon is beautiful to behold on a restless night .                                                               |
| **`pcc_eng_02_007.9015_x0111391_26:11-13-14`** | No one type is better than the other , and nothing is __``ever black``__ and white .                                                                                                                                                |
| **`pcc_eng_19_046.9595_x0741744_09:26-30-31`** | And here 's the trick which is my alternative view on where we should be focused - Not all Cancer is black and white and nothing in cancer is __``ever black``__ and white .                                                        |
| **`pcc_eng_27_104.5460_x1675091_08:18-20-21`** | If I 've learnt anything in my twenty six years on the planet , it 's that nothing is __``ever black``__ and white ; there 's infinite shades of grey .                                                                             |
| **`pcc_eng_26_093.2542_x1491955_06:1-3-4`**    | Nothing is __``ever black``__ or white and there 's an awful lot of grey between the two extremes .                                                                                                                                 |
| **`pcc_eng_03_089.2243_x1428732_14:2-4-5`**    | But nothing is __``ever black``__ and white , and Nazif Iflazoglu in today 's Radikal went some way to show that the AKP might not have been entirely driven by a stubborn desire to protect the apparent sanctity of Turkishness . |
