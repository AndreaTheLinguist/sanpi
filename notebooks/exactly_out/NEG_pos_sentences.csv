other cryptocurrencies you know question of where to start how to buy your very first Bitcoin what going to do today is take you through the entire process of creating your very first wallet all the way through to buying your Bitcoin now I blockchain to run the most popular while it's out there there are other wallets available as well such as coin base or Exodus I've actually got tutorials of those as well so if you'd like to have a look then please look through the series of these videos now I use blockchain as my very first Bitcoin boy and wallet so and that's the reason why I've chosen this one also the fact that you can purchase your bitcoins through credit or debit cards is really helpful so let's take us through that process now so if you navigate to blockchain info please ensure that you put the exact address into here maybe put it into your bookmarks and to be always ensuring that you're going to the same site now like I said blockchain is one of the most popular and well trusted of one it's and obviously they're saying here there that number one digital wallets they've got 100 million transactions with 15 million wallets out there as well so what we're going to do is go through and create our first wallet now these wallets obviously are free as well and in here make sure that you put in quite a complex password so that it is strong and then go through and read the Terms and Conditions and then click on to continue what it's now done is gone through and created that wallet for me and it's given me an identifier as well what I now need to do is verify my email so I'm going to go to my gmail account here and click on to this email now in here you can see that I've got a wallet ID and now this Warner ID is almost like a username that you would use to log in to any kind of application or almost like your kind of credentials now this is something that you need to keep personal to you and so please ensure that you have a copy of this wallet ID maybe print it off and put it into a safe maybe put it to a password-protected documents something like that anyway and keep that personal to you now obviously this is just a test account that I'm using so I can show you my wallet ID but just make sure you keep that personal and obviously go through and verify your email now that's done I'll return back to my blockchain website and I'm just going to exit out of that for the moment what I do is I'll take you through different options here on the left-hand side and then we'll go through and show you how to buy your very first Bitcoin and all the different options in here as well so what you have when you first go into blockchain is like a dashboard so from here you can send and receive Bitcoin or ether you can view your balances you can view how the value is tracking you can go through and they also have a mobile app as well which I find really helpful one of the good things about the mobile app is that obviously you can use your own additional security like fingerprinting and things like that and you've just got a nice little app and you can download if you wish so blockchain allow you to have two different crypto currencies which are Bitcoin and ISA so you can have two different wallets so you have your Bitcoin wallet so when you click on here you can send and receive Bitcoin and you can view any transactions that you may have made and hear and then you have ether as well so you can get started have a look at your transactions again you then have the option in here to buy and sell Bitcoin that will go through that shortly after I've gone through the different options you then have an exchange so in here you're able to exchange from Bitcoin to ether and ethers do Bitcoin you have em have your Security Center so this is the section I'm going to go through first and now we've already gone through and we have verified our email and so that's all good now the next thing you have is a backup recovery phase now this is really important the reason why this is important is purely for the fact that instead of it for example you lose your password or you can't remember it for any reason there is no option for you to reset that password with blockchain they don't store the passwords so what you need to do is ensure that you have a backup recovery phrase so for any reason you can't remember your password or you can't remember your details what you can do is revert back to this backup phrase what it does it provides you with a list of words so I'll just take us through there and it gives me some words so it gives me a sort of North stairs narrow prevent and what you should do with these words is you need to print them off again you need to put them into a safe or you need to put them into a password-protected document or something along those lines and have those so that they are safe to you obviously you shouldn't share those again this for the purposes of this tutorial and I can show you those words but you need to keep those words and save to yourself you then have a password hint so it's just additional help in case you've forgotten it you then have the option of level two to prevent unauthorized access to your wallet so you can link in a mobile phone in here and what it will allow you to do is use it like an authentication so and you can use an app such as Google Authenticator which you can download from the App Store and what it provides you with is like a one-time passcode so that when you go to log into blockchain you obviously put in your wallet ID you put in your password and then it'll provide you with a like a numeric number that will be available for 30 seconds and you can enter that into the login script as well so it's just really securing it and ensuring that you know it is you that is trying to log into your blockchain wallet so you can go through and you can enable those steps in there as well you then have an advanced level of security as well where you can block tour requests if I now take us through to our settings so in here it provides me with my wallet ID so this is the ID that we got provided to in our Gmail earlier on so this is my unique wallet ID that is personal to me that I must not share with others so this isn't the address that you used to send or receive Bitcoin or anything like it's purely your you know your credentials so to speak in here as well you can pay your mobile phone like I explained you don't have preferences so in here you can put in your mobile number you can choose a wallet language there's a lot of different languages within this and section obviously I'm English so I'm keeping that to English you can then choose your local currency again I'm from the UK so mine's currently set to GDP but there's loads of different currencies in here that you can use you then have Bitcoin unit so and you can obviously choose from Bitcoin Miller Bitcoin or bits you then have notifications so you can be notified via email or via SMS when you receive Bitcoin you then have an things like the auto logout so this could be really important if for example you you know you keep yourself logged in and you forget to sign out what you need to do is do you need to you know you can change the different period of time here so it automatically logs you out and no-one can nip onto your computer and start using it now I personally would recommend clicking on the sign up button as soon as you're finished but this will just give you kind of like an additional layer again and ensuring that you can you know obviously log out of this account now if you are using a public computer such as an internet cafe or using someone else's computer again just make sure that you click on sign out but you do have that additional layer of auto log out there as well in terms of security so this is where we have the wallet recovery phrase so like I said this is just in case you forget your password you can change your password in here as well you have your password hint you've got a second wallet password this is where you can enable that two-factor authentication with that one-time code as well and you can have a remember and there as well then you have a drive addresses so in here you can manage different addresses say for example you wanted to categorize things within your Bitcoin wallet and you wanted to say all my expenses and you want to put all your categories in there as well or everything this receipts everything that comes a certain address it just kind of you are your own bank so what you're essentially doing just categorizing things and explaining you know what the different addresses are for you've then got an FAQ section in here as well so you know very simple questions being answered if you've got any questions you want to ask me please feel free but this is in here as well so it's just kind of helpful it's what I'm gonna do now is go to buy our first Bitcoin now before you go through and buy your first Bitcoin it's always important that you and verify all your information so put in your mobile number they might ask you for further verification such as your address and where you're from and your date of birth and things like that so just make sure that you go through all of those steps so in here you can see that if I type in an amount which is 100 pounds it'll then give me my conversion into an Bitcoin what it also does it tells me the current value of Bitcoin at the moment or I could choose whether or not I want to purchase in and US dollars or Euros and different types of options in here as well if I then click on to my Bitcoin in here you have two different options so like I said previously and the really good thing about blockchain is the fact you can purchase Bitcoin using a credit or debit card or via bank transfer now when I first bought my first Bitcoin and I made a little bit of an error and I thought you know I wanted to save a little bit of the and the fees that were being charged in here and so as you can see credit cards have got a 3% and fee and bank transfer has got a not 025 percent fee so what I thought I'd do the first time around is I'm saving myself on the fees and choose bank transfer now the one thing to be aware of here is if you go for bank transfer like I have and you know different banks vary but however from the UK I actually got charged a 25 pound international fee so instead of receiving a fee of for example 3% so if I was looking at a hundred pounds I've been looking at paying 3 pounds instead of paying 3 pounds I actually paid 25 and so just be a little bit wary of which option you choose in here I quite like the convenience of the fact that you can use a credit or debit card in here as well so I'm going to select that option and go to continue so in here is a confirmation of your order and so it allows you to and go through you can edit it in here as well and it'll tell you about a Bitcoin it tells you your payment fee and and your total cost if you then click on to confirm so what I then did was I put in my credit card details obviously I didn't share those and then I went through and confirmed that and then bought my first Bitcoin so what I'm gonna do now is show you how to receive Bitcoin from others so if I click on to request you can select the type of currency that you would like to receive so whether or not that be a Bitcoin or whether or not that be ether you're then provided with an address so this is like a one-time address for this transaction so I could and copy this link and send it to the person that's sending me the the cryptocurrency or I can view the QR code in here as well so if they've got a mobile app and they want to send me and you know cryptocurrency then what they can do is simply and scan in that QR code or again from this screen you can simply click copy ill then state that it's copied you can then send that across to them if you then like to send Bitcoin or ether of course and you can often see select again you select the type of currency and then you put in their destination address so you would either put in an address or a destination any time that you're putting in an address or a destination you really need to make sure that you I'm going to make sure that it is exactly correct so check every single letter CH at the beginning check the end make sure it's exactly right because once you've sent that Bitcoin it's gone but you can also use that QR code again in here as well if you so wish and keeps a little bit more secure but it depends on you know what you're sending to and whether or not you have that available or not and if I now choose and to send a certain amount for example if I put in five US dollars here again it does that conversion for me and then it allows me to put in description so I could put in a description in here to the person that I'm sending it to and and then it will and obviously give it a description so it's just like I said we're our own bank we're just categorizing with paying descriptions in here just so we can track things through through the wallet we then have an option in here for the transaction fee so you have an option to go regular which is they say the current confirmation time is one hour plus or you can go priority where it will do it under an hour now I tend to find I'm mostly used and the regular system purely for the fact that it normally happens under an hour anyway and but you know it's up to you which way you choose and obviously you know you've got the rates and how much you're actually gonna be charged to this and as well if I now click on to continue it would then take me through the process of sending that Bitcoin and it would send that for us so

any kind of application or almost like your kind of credentials now this is something that you need to keep personal to you and so please ensure that you have a copy of this wallet ID maybe print it off and put it into a safe maybe put it to a password-protected documents something like that anyway and keep that personal to you now obviously this is just a test account that I'm using so I can show you my wallet ID but just make sure you keep that personal and obviously go through and verify your email now that's done I'll return back to my blockchain website and I'm just going to exit out of that for the moment what I do is I'll take you through different options here on the left-hand side and then we'll go through and show you how to buy your very first Bitcoin and all the different options in here as well so what you have when you first go into blockchain is like a dashboard so from here you can send and receive Bitcoin or ether you can view your balances you can view how the value is tracking you can go through and they also have a mobile app as well which I find really helpful one of the good things about the mobile app is that obviously you can use your own additional security like fingerprinting and things like that and you've just got a nice little app and you can download if you wish so blockchain allow you to have two different crypto currencies which are Bitcoin and ISA so you can have two different wallets so you have your Bitcoin wallet so when you click on here you can send and receive Bitcoin and you can view any transactions that you may have made and hear and then you have ether as well so you can get started have a look at your transactions again you then have the option in here to buy and sell Bitcoin that will go through that shortly after I've gone through the different options you then have an exchange so in here you're able to exchange from Bitcoin to ether and ethers do Bitcoin you have em have your Security Center so this is the section I'm going to go through first and now we've already gone through and we have verified our email and so that's all good now the next thing you have is a backup recovery phase now this is really important the reason why this is important is purely for the fact that instead of it for example you lose your password or you can't remember it for any reason there is no option for you to reset that password with blockchain they don't store the passwords so what you need to do is ensure that you have a backup recovery phrase so for any reason you can't remember your password or you can't remember your details what you can do is revert back to this backup phrase what it does it provides you with a list of words so I'll just take us through there and it gives me some words so it gives me a sort of North stairs narrow prevent and what you should do with these words is you need to print them off again you need to put them into a safe or you need to put them into a password-protected document or something along those lines and have those so that they are safe to you obviously you shouldn't share those again this for the purposes of this tutorial and I can show you those words but you need to keep those words and save to yourself you then have a password hint so it's just additional help in case you've forgotten it you then have the option of level two to prevent unauthorized access to your wallet so you can link in a mobile phone in here and what it will allow you to do is use it like an authentication so and you can use an app such as Google Authenticator which you can download from the App Store and what it provides you with is like a one-time passcode so that when you go to log into blockchain you obviously put in your wallet ID you put in your password and then it'll provide you with a like a numeric number that will be available for 30 seconds and you can enter that into the login script as well so it's just really securing it and ensuring that you know it is you that is trying to log into your blockchain wallet so you can go through and you can enable those steps in there as well you then have an advanced level of security as well where you can block tour requests if I now take us through to our settings so in here it provides me with my wallet ID so this is the ID that we got provided to in our Gmail earlier on so this is my unique wallet ID that is personal to me that I must not share with others so this isn't the address that you used to send or receive Bitcoin or anything like it's purely your you know your credentials so to speak in here as well you can pay your mobile phone like I explained you don't have preferences so in here you can put in your mobile number you can choose a wallet language there's a lot of different languages within this and section obviously I'm English so I'm keeping that to English you can then choose your local currency again I'm from the UK so mine's currently set to GDP but there's loads of different currencies in here that you can use you then have Bitcoin unit so and you can obviously choose from Bitcoin Miller Bitcoin or bits you then have notifications so you can be notified via email or via SMS when you receive Bitcoin you then have an things like the auto logout so this could be really important if for example you you know you keep yourself logged in and you forget to sign out what you need to do is do you need to you know you can change the different period of time here so it automatically logs you out and no-one can nip onto your computer and start using it now I personally would recommend clicking on the sign up button as soon as you're finished but this will just give you kind of like an additional layer again and ensuring that you can you know obviously log out of this account now if you are using a public computer such as an internet cafe or using someone else's computer again just make sure that you click on sign out but you do have that additional layer of auto log out there as well in terms of security so this is where we have the wallet recovery phrase so like I said this is just in case you forget your password you can change your password in here as well you have your password hint you've got a second wallet password this is where you can enable that two-factor authentication with that one-time code as well and you can have a remember and there as well then you have a drive addresses so in here you can manage different addresses say for example you wanted to categorize things within your Bitcoin wallet and you wanted to say all my expenses and you want to put all your categories in there as well or everything this receipts everything that comes a certain address it just kind of you are your own bank so what you're essentially doing just categorizing things and explaining you know what the different addresses are for you've then got an FAQ section in here as well so you know very simple questions being answered if you've got any questions you want to ask me please feel free but this is in here as well so it's just kind of helpful it's what I'm gonna do now is go to buy our first Bitcoin now before you go through and buy your first Bitcoin it's always important that you and verify all your information so put in your mobile number they might ask you for further verification such as your address and where you're from and your date of birth and things like that so just make sure that you go through all of those steps so in here you can see that if I type in an amount which is 100 pounds it'll then give me my conversion into an Bitcoin what it also does it tells me the current value of Bitcoin at the moment or I could choose whether or not I want to purchase in and US dollars or Euros and different types of options in here as well if I then click on to my Bitcoin in here you have two different options so like I said previously and the really good thing about blockchain is the fact you can purchase Bitcoin using a credit or debit card or via bank transfer now when I first bought my first Bitcoin and I made a little bit of an error and I thought you know I wanted to save a little bit of the and the fees that were being charged in here and so as you can see credit cards have got a 3% and fee and bank transfer has got a not 025 percent fee so what I thought I'd do the first time around is I'm saving myself on the fees and choose bank transfer now the one thing to be aware of here is if you go for bank transfer like I have and you know different banks vary but however from the UK I actually got charged a 25 pound international fee so instead of receiving a fee of for example 3% so if I was looking at a hundred pounds I've been looking at paying 3 pounds instead of paying 3 pounds I actually paid 25 and so just be a little bit wary of which option you choose in here I quite like the convenience of the fact that you can use a credit or debit card in here as well so I'm going to select that option and go to continue so in here is a confirmation of your order and so it allows you to and go through you can edit it in here as well and it'll tell you about a Bitcoin it tells you your payment fee and and your total cost if you then click on to confirm so what I then did was I put in my credit card details obviously I didn't share those and then I went through and confirmed that and then bought my first Bitcoin so what I'm gonna do now is show you how to receive Bitcoin from others so if I click on to request you can select the type of currency that you would like to receive so whether or not that be a Bitcoin or whether or not that be ether you're then provided with an address so this is like a one-time address for this transaction so I could and copy this link and send it to the person that's sending me the the cryptocurrency or I can view the QR code in here as well so if they've got a mobile app and they want to send me and you know cryptocurrency then what they can do is simply and scan in that QR code or again from this screen you can simply click copy ill then state that it's copied you can then send that across to them if you then like to send Bitcoin or ether of course and you can often see select again you select the type of currency and then you put in their destination address so you would either put in an address or a destination any time that you're putting in an address or a destination you really need to make sure that you I'm going to make sure that it is exactly correct so check every single letter CH at the beginning check the end make sure it's exactly right because once you've sent that Bitcoin it's gone but you can also use that QR code again in here as well if you so wish and keeps a little bit more secure but it depends on you know what you're sending to and whether or not you have that available or not and if I now choose and to send a certain amount for example if I put in five US dollars here again it does that conversion for me and then it allows me to put in description so I could put in a description in here to the person that I'm sending it to and and then it will and obviously give it a description so it's just like I said we're our own bank we're just categorizing with paying descriptions in here just so we can track things through through the wallet we then have an option in here for the transaction fee so you have an option to go regular which is they say the current confirmation time is one hour plus or you can go priority where it will do it under an hour now I tend to find I'm mostly used and the regular system purely for the fact that it normally happens under an hour anyway and but you know it's up to you which way you choose and obviously you know you've got the rates and how much you're actually gonna be charged to this and as well if I now click on to continue it would then take me through the process of sending that Bitcoin and it would send that for us so my blockchain tutorial I hope that you found it useful if you're interested in seeing more from this series then please hit subscribe there's a few other tutorials in there as well that you might be interested in such as coinbase or Exodus if you liked it then please give me a like or if you have any comments please put them below thanks and I'll see you

live... will be back in thirty seconds... the Federal Reserve policy committee stocks an important two-day meeting tomorrow... and then and they will face some overlapping challenges... it's quite don't like what they've seen recently the list as Josh Zumbrun joins us now from Washington... toss thanks obeying map... they had a nice and... now the Federal Reserve has eight a dual mandate one is stable amassed a stable price level which is stable inflation and aam full employment... and right now the they call the set of overlapping consent still small... the drop in oil rigs really interesting conundrum for the Fed because it pushes... and that the way this is what's happening the passes that low prices is served as a little bit of a boost to growth see you expect the Fed to get to its employment go a bit faster you know people will have... more money to spend on something other than gasoline that's typically good for the economy... the other hand that the drop in gasoline prices is set to push measures of inflation... very low and that the Fed already inflation is already running below the Fed's... comfort level they really want two percent inflation or at... the no one and a half or something and then did this drop in oil could pushing... him down to zero by some estimates though... it's can be significantly too low... for what the feds come to go with them and creates a conundrum in terms of how they how they respond to this and tell us we have a EIA Tilson Ruhana Ahmed if oil goes to sixty dollars a barrel and inflation will be... aam Marzilli positive five point two percent unemployment five point five percent... and monthly job gains of now the up close to two hundred thousands... but if we have forty dollars and all the barrel oil which nominees know on how tall the toll on inflation goes negative thoughts and to devise deflation By Sue its unemployment five point two percent and monthly change in private payrolls... close to a quarter of a million every month net new jobs created so that is the conundrum is Nate's of folding price level is now seen as very touched... by a rising jobs market is seen as very very debt... that's exactly right one of the key things to watch is going to be the nations of... you know the so called core inflation which is... inflation but excluding the law and excluding... our food prices... the Fed why is that they can get it that they they see that if the underlying trend... and if that major holds an in forecasting an eighteen businessman... the forecasters from IHS coincides in core inflation is going to... remain ever around two percent no matter what happens... and if that's the case then the Fed probably didn't have confidence that this is... really just about the oil price drop that that that the low inflation measures don't see no reason underlying weakness in the economy... and so if that's the case they might fill comparable going ahead with the first interest rate increase sometime next year now what one other things we should point out is the forty dollars is the flaw foil it was back to back in that ninth in the late nineties it was down to... around about ten dollars a barrel so this could go with the choir loft of that... and if you like it could present even bigger problems for the fat... that's right and and this one thing is different about this area is that you know fifteen years ago the U S produced very little oil compared to what it does today now I have that... the fracking boom we've had huge new supplies brought on in the United States sell... these to be the case of this is just basically a tax cut for people in Pakistan is less money and that... gasoline calm but now this Asa does damage to a lot of... that U S oil producers and you know there's a lot of... us Johnson high wage U S jobs tied to its energy sector... and so it's a much more mixed picture even for growth and a nice to be as much a complicated situation the ECB with a
