| **`pcc_eng_01_098.1773_x1571097_03:3-4-5`**     | There 's nothing __`terribly original`__ about the premise or plot of " Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience ( tm ) " by Rebecca Roanhorse , but do not mistake this observation for an unfriendly critique .        |
| **`pcc_eng_24_103.1597_x1652783_09:7-8-9`**     | Ok , so the setup is n't __`terribly original`__ .                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **`pcc_eng_24_086.2673_x1379137_12:15-16-17`**  | As far as forays into contemporary masculine psychology go , Hymowitz 's essay was n't __`terribly original`__ .                                                                                                            |
| **`pcc_eng_16_088.0325_x1408847_017:13-14-15`** | In its place , a new identity would form that , while not __`terribly original`__ in the context of the times , was nonetheless a much truer vision of who he was .                                                         |
| **`pcc_eng_22_084.8728_x1355692_20:11-12-13`**  | But it 's worth pointing out that the movie is n't __`terribly original`__ .                                                                                                                                                |
| **`pcc_eng_25_096.5754_x1546741_106:5-6-7`**    | I guess that 's nothing __`terribly original`__ or useful .                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **`pcc_eng_14_030.4738_x0476280_28:6-7-8`**     | I said the plot was n't __`terribly original`__ , but I have n't seen much like this , so it was original enough for me .                                                                                                   |
| **`pcc_eng_29_003.8577_x0046227_27:4-5-6`**     | The denoument is n't __`terribly original`__ but the central conceit , mingling present and two layers of past events , works well , and there 's certainly more substance to this than to the average haunted house tale . |
