    "# Using `stanza` to parse unsegmented texts from cleaned dataframe of Pile data\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm using `stanza` instead of the raw stanford core nlp model because this is designed to be run with python and I don't have to interface with java, which was causing a considerable headache. The other python interface packages like `nltk` still required instantiating a java corenlp server, and, on WSL, I can't specify a port that will actually work to do that. Using the corenlp parser would work on kay or woods or kuno, but I'm using python and pandas to clean things up, create document IDs, and filter to the data sets we are interested in. Using the command line tool requires a text file input; while it's possible to save every document to a text file and parse it that way, it has the following drawbacks: \n",
    "\n",
    "- requires writing a lot of temporary, unneeded files\n",
    "- doesn't allow for adding comments along the way \n",
    "- doesn't allow for sentence ID creation and annotating in the step between parsing and writing\n",
    "- generally is more restrictive in its output, so there would need to be another round of processing/reformatting after the parsing step. \n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, the text can be pulled directly from the dataframe and have the necessary metadata as well.\n"

      "And on Friday (Sept. 28) it will go away.\n",
      "Kevin Desmond is the head of King County Metro.\n",
      "He says the deficit the system is facing is about $6o million, annually.\n",
      "\"To be perfectly honest, we're trying to save the service for all the people who use it,\" Desmond says.\n",
      "\"So, the ride-fee area had its place for 40 years.\n",
      "We are the only city in the United States now that has such a ride-free area.\n",
      "Cities throughout the world, you pay fare to use transit. \"\n",
      "He says even Portland, Ore., recently phased out theirs for buses and the Max light-rail line.\n",

      "A new group called the Transit Riders Union has started meeting on Monday nights at Seattle's labor temple.\n",
      "They're advocating for a revival of the free ride zone and they'll lead what they're calling a \"funeral march\" on Friday afternoon, along with longer-standing homeless groups such as share/wheel.\n",
      "Katie Wilson is an organizer with the new group that is trying to raise awareness for people like her and others who are worse off.\n",
      "She says she's 30-years-old, doing odd jobs to make ends meet.\n",

      "The county says Metro is facing a $60 million deficit, just to maintain the service it has.\n",
      "They've streamlined many routes to save money and eliminating Seattle's ride-free zone is part of that picture.\n",

      "Judge orders Lev Tahor youths into care of children's aid but most have already left Canada\n",
      "CHATHAM, Ont. --\n",
      "An Ontario judge has issued an emergency order that 14 children from an ultra-orthodox Jewish sect at the centre of a custody case be placed in the care of children's aid, but police said Thursday most of the children have left the country.\n",
      "Two families whose children were ordered removed from their custody left Canada for Guatemala this week, but some of the travellers were detained in Trinidad and Tobago during a stopover, according to a Lev Tahor member's email to supporters, which was obtained by The Canadian Press.\n",
      "Immigration authorities in Trinidad met Wednesday with Canadian Embassy officials to inform them of the ongoing developments regarding Lev Tahor and \"to advise with the consultation of the Canadian authorities on the way forward,\" said Marcia Hope, a spokeswoman for that country's Ministry of National Security.\n",
      "Hope could not say whether Canadian police are involved in the discussions and as of late Thursday morning authorities in Trinidad had not received \"evidential proof\" the Lev Tahor members were the subject of a Canadian court order, she said.\n",
      "A judge in Chatham, Ont., has ordered that 14 Lev Tahor children be placed in the temporary care of Chatham-Kent Children's Services.\n",
      "The order, which was released Thursday, says the agency can ask for assistance from local and provincial police, Canada Border Services Agency, the RCMP and Peel Regional police, whose jurisdiction includes the Toronto Pearson International Airport.\n",
      "Chatham-Kent police said Thursday afternoon that 12 of the 14 children named in the emergency order have left the country.\n",
      "They said police and child services are trying to locate the remaining two children.\n",
      "Canadian authorities in Ottawa did not respond to repeated requests for information.\n",
      "However, Canada Border Services Agency has said it cannot detain anyone without a search warrant.\n",
      "One legal expert said any kind of extradition proceedings could only occur if someone faced criminal charges.\n",
      "Two local police officers and four children's aid workers went door to door Wednesday night in the community of homes in Chatham, hours after the court order was made.\n",
      "A community spokesman confirmed police were looking for the children at the centre of the court case.\n",
      "A Canadian Press reporter, who was at the Lev Tahor complex when authorities arrived, could hear the officers ask parents to see their children and to produce identification.\n",
      "The police officers and child welfare workers stayed at the complex for about 90 minutes and left around 10 p.m. without apprehending anyone.\n",
      "A provincial police spokesman said they have not yet received a request for assistance from children's aid in Chatham.\n",
      "A Quebec court originally ordered late last year that 14 Lev Tahor children be placed in foster care after the community of about 200 people left their homes in Ste-Agathe-des-Monts, Que., in the middle of the night, days after a child welfare agency started a court case against a couple of the families.\n",
      "The community settled in Chatham, Ont., where a judge found last month that their move from Quebec was made to avoid the custody proceeding there and he ordered that 13 Lev Tahor children be turned over to child protection authorities in Quebec.\n",
      "The judge didn't include one girl who is both under 18 and a mother of an infant in his order.\n",
      "He delayed enforcement of that order so the families could have a chance to appeal.\n",
      "That appeal was scheduled to be heard Wednesday in Chatham, but instead Chatham-Kent Children's Services brought an emergency motion that resulted in the order to place the kids in temporary care.\n",
      "The community member's email said that part of the group was going to Guatemala via Mexico and the other part was travelling via Trinidad.\n",
      "The email indicated that members of one family are American citizens and the others are Israeli citizens and both families were in Canada on work permits, so they dispute that they should be sent to Canada, instead they're pushing to be allowed to travel on to Guatemala.\n",
      "Hope said in a statement that the Lev Tahor members are not being detained in Trinidad, as they are free to return to Canada, however officials are holding onto their passports.\n",
      "They were stopped after immigration officials found \"inconsistencies\" in the group's statements, Hope said.\n",
      "The group has also hired a local lawyer, Farai Hove Masaisai, who said Thursday from Port-of-Spain he was still trying to get access to his clients, who he said were being kept in an undisclosed location near the airport.\n",
      "A court did direct authorities on Thursday to grant such access, likely later today, he said.\n",
      "Masaisai said he had no idea about the Canadian custody court order when informed by The Canadian Press about it, but called it \"something very serious.\"\n",
      "Contrary to what Trinidadian authorities said Thursday, Masaisai said the nine sect members were in fact being detained.\n",
      "\"They can't leave.\n",
      "They can't come and go as they please.\n",
      "They're being detained,\" Masaisai said.\n",
      "\"Immigration has a lot of powers, so they could send them anywhere they choose.\"\n",
      "Masaisai said he hoped to be able to take translators to a meeting with his clients given that only one of them speaks a little English.\n",
      "The actual appeal of the Canadian court order is now scheduled to be heard April 4.\n",
      "The Lev Tahor, which means \"pure heart,\" came to Canada in 2005 after their spiritual leader, Rabbi Shlomo Elbarnes, was granted refugee status here.\n",
      "The community was under investigation for issues including hygiene, children's health and allegations that the children weren't learning according to the provincial curriculum.\n",
      "Testimony from social workers has highlighted concerns that the community is almost completely isolated from the outside world, the children are terrified of others who are not modestly dressed or \"pure,\" and some girls are married as teenagers.\n",
      "Ross, like Bruce Bowen, has found minutes in the league strictly for his defensive capabilities.\n",
      "Unlike Bowen, Ross doesn't shoot the rock particularly well from any range, and injuries limited him to just 52 games last season.\n",
      "He's seen his minutes drop significantly over the past two seasons since leaving the Clippers (one of the rare cases when a player's career worsens after leaving the Clips).\n",
      "He averaged a paltry 1.5 PPG in 2009.\n",
      "2009-10\n",
      "Ross spent the first five seasons of his NBA career with the Clippers and Grizzlies and comes to Dallas sporting a career scoring average just above four points.\n",
      "While the Mavs hope his career three-point percentage of 34.6 will help them spread the floor, Ross will be utilized more as a defensive specialist.\n",
      "2007-08\n",
      "Ross is strictly a defensive specialist for the Clippers, and holds no fantasy value.\n",
      "The presence of rookie Al Thornton could also eat away at Ross' playing time, and he should not be considered in any fantasy format.\n",
      "2006-07\n",
      "Ross does the dirty work for the Clippers.\n",
      "He will help chew up minutes off the bench and is an excellent perimeter defender.\n",
      "He doesn't score very often though.\n",
      "2004-05\n",
      "Ross will start the season on the bench.\n",
      "He is, however, athletic as they come and a more than capable defender.\n",

      "2003-04\n",
      "An undrafted rookie with marginal upside.\n",
      "Greatly improved in each of his four college years.\n",

      "Back to Gallery\n",
      "Bandoleone restaurant will close its doors indefinitely after Sunday, blaming the just-started work on the Fremont Bridge for turning the front of its business into a construction zone.\n",
      "Owner Danielle Philippa, who ran the restaurant for more than 10 years -- including the last 20 months it has been in Fremont -- said business has dropped off 86 percent since the bridge work started Monday.\n",
      "The city is doing an extensive renovation of the 89-year-old bridge, including significant seismic and structural work, construction of new bridge approaches and mechanical and electrical improvements.\n",
      "The work is expected to continue through next spring.\n",
      "For much of the time, one lane will remain open to traffic, but some full closures are planned in June.\n",
      "There were plenty of traffic snarls and snarling drivers this week as people figured out the new routes.\n",
      "Several Fremont business owners said customers are still managing to find them, though.\n",
      "But Philippa blamed her dramatic drop in customers on a tall cyclone fence that is blocking her restaurant and the jackhammer noise at night when people are dining.\n",
      "\"I would tough it out if it was just going to be a couple of weeks, but it isn't going to get better,\" she said.\n",
      "\"The entire summer is shot, and summer is our best time.\"\n",
      "When the weather is mild, Bandoleone diners fill outdoor tables and watch the activity in downtown Fremont.\n",
      "Now the construction work and fence block the view.\n",
      "\"I had to sit the staff down and let them know that we had to look at closing our doors,\" Philippa said.\n",
      "Other Fremont business owners are trying to be creative.\n",
      "Capers owner Lisa Myers said she is thinking about hanging humorous banners on the store to draw attention to it, and is passing out Now and Later candies to frustrated drivers.\n",
      "She's e-mailing her customers with detailed directions for avoiding the construction tangle and reminders that Capers has plenty of parking.\n",
      "The store offers a mix of home decor, furniture, gifts and other products.\n",
      "Myers said she fully expects Capers to survive the bridge project.\n",
      "\"You have to turn it around and make it work for you,\" she said.\n",
      "\"So far so good.\"\n",
      "Other Fremont business owners say it is too soon to tell, but they're remaining optimistic.\n",
      "\"The first few days I didn't see a drop-off in my business,\" said Lisa Perry, owner of Ophelia's Books.\n",
      "\"As long as people are aware that it is a little different, they won't have a problem.\n",
      "The new traffic circulation is pretty well signed, and it keeps things moving.\n",
      "\"I think most people around here are pleasantly surprised that there wasn't a big drop-off this week.\"\n",
      "City officials saidthey are sympathetic to businesses caught in the construction zone, but there is little they can do to help out individual retailers.\n",
      "\"No doubt because of their location, there is pretty intense construction,\" she said.\n",
      "\"But I think it may have been one of many things for them.\"\n",
      "Turner said there isn't much the city can do for businesses in the path of road repairs or bridge work.\n",
      "\"The sad thing is that big construction projects do have an impact on businesses that are marginal,\" Turner said.\n",
      "At the request of business owners, the city is keeping the Fremont Bridge open to traffic as much as possible, even though that means construction will drag on a little longer.\n",
      "\"We have avoided total closure over the weekend,\" Turner said.\n",
      "\"I think that is significant.\"\n",
      "Work planned for the next several weeks to remove the east half of the bridge approaches will be particularly disruptive.\n",
      "That work is expected to be completed by June 24.\n",
      "Marty McOmber, a spokesman for Mayor Greg Nickels, said the Transportation Department has gone out of its way to work with the community, \"recognizing that it is a vital project, but a disruptive one.\"\n",
      "McOmber said the project has just started and adjustments will be made along the way.\n",
      "\"Obviously there are some things the city can do to mitigate the impact, to work around the needs of the businesses, and to make sure people know those businesses are open,\" he said.\n",
      "At Bandoleone, Philippa acknowledged that it has been a difficult couple of years.\n",
      "The restaurant was forced to leave itspopular Eastlake location after more than eight years when the building's owners decided to tear it down.\n",
      "In Fremont, parking was limited, and then the Aurora Bridge construction last year blocked the bike and boat access that the restaurant had been counting on.\n",
      "Philippa said that work cut into herprofits, but the restaurant wasmanaging to break even.\n",
      "Recently, business was improving.\n",
      "But the Fremont Bridge construction hit Bandoleone harder than she expected.\n",
      "\"It doesn't feel like you are sitting on a patio in Madrid anymore, watching the boats,\" she said.\n",
      "\"You just hear jackhammers.\"\n"
