"                                                                                   |
| **`pcc_eng_09_070.5530_x1125077_4:4-5`**    | Do they make __``terribly original``__ music ?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **`pcc_eng_20_086.8532_x1387023_40:36-37`** | I first read Emma Bull's War for the Oaks in 2001 , and I really liked it at the time , perhaps because this novel was my first experience of urban fantasy and it seemed __``terribly original``__ , fresh and new ( as it probably was when it was first published in 1987 . ) |
