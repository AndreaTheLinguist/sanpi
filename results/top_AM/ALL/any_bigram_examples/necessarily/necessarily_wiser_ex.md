| **`pcc_eng_04_076.2278_x1214949_10:27-28-29`**  | Today the generational divide opened up to me again on this subject , this time with me sitting on the side of the elder - although not __``necessarily wiser``__ , generation . |
| **`pcc_eng_17_108.00939_x1732468_55:22-23-24`** | At the beginning we are thrust into strange territory , and by the end we are back on familiar grounds , not __``necessarily wiser``__ but definitely changed .                  |
| **`pcc_eng_25_045.7341_x0724136_17:12-13-14`**  | Campbell confirmed that he would star as an older , but not __``necessarily wiser``__ , Ash .                                                                                    |
| **`pcc_eng_19_072.8203_x1160118_17:17-18-19`**  | Yet his failure to alert the children 's parents of their intentions may prove older is not __``necessarily wiser``__ .                                                          |
| **`pcc_eng_25_081.1930_x1298308_21:7-8-9`**     | We find an older - but not __``necessarily wiser``__ - Ash strapping himself in , but not to a chainsaw / shotgun brace , rather a man size girdle .                             |
| **`pcc_eng_26_003.6055_x0041889_229:16-17-18`** | I 'm inclined to say no simply because he 's much older now - although not __``necessarily wiser``__ - but he may not have the energy and resolve for that kind of move .        |
| **`pcc_eng_03_007.1202_x0098909_25:17-18-19`**  | You 'd like to know that the person you 're talking to is older , if not __``necessarily wiser``__ , and has a little perspective on what looks terribly scary . "               |
