| **`pcc_eng_20_006.3181_x0085665_11:10-11-12`**  | This is a lovely sentiment , but it 's not __``remotely true``__ .                                                                                                                                   |
| **`pcc_eng_14_041.4911_x0654240_47:09-10`**     | Even if the items I imagined had been __``remotely true``__ , we would have handled them on Monday .                                                                                                 |
| **`pcc_eng_23_012.0536_x0178318_108:1-6-7`**    | Neither of those things are __``remotely true``__ , but I made Top 8 and this is my list .                                                                                                           |
| **`pcc_eng_test_3.01795_x37265_16:34-35-36`**   | This is such a great question because I think there 's a popular perception that all a historian really needs is a great memory for names and dates , which is of course not __``remotely true``__ . |
| **`pcc_eng_00_004.9132_x0063132_2:4-5-6`**      | " It is not __``remotely true``__ that we are interested in Lichtsteiner , " he said in a press conference on the eve of their trip to Ajaccio on Friday .                                           |
| **`pcc_eng_26_008.0465_x0113678_033:13-15-16`** | In fact , not only is that inherently contradictory , it is not even __``remotely true``__ .                                                                                                         |
| **`pcc_eng_22_057.1873_x0908045_41:04-10-11`**  | Of course , none of this could be even __``remotely true``__ because I 'm not a data scientist or statistician .                                                                                     |
| **`pcc_eng_14_070.8574_x1129385_25:5-6`**       | IF this is even __``remotely true``__ then why is our entire Sunday morning experience focused on what we read and say ?!?                                                                           |
