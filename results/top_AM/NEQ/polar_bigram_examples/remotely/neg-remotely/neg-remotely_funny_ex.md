| **`pcc_eng_23_034.0465_x0533540_095:14-15-16`** | However the last 2 nights with the adult comedians were truly vulgar and not __``remotely funny``__ and a waste of our time .                                                                                                                       |

| **`nyt_eng_20050103_0141_23:16-18-19`**         | although Poston is appropriately grumpy , Darius McCrary -LRB- `` Family Matters '' -RRB- offers nothing even __``remotely funny``__ as Nate 's friend and co-worker .                                                                              |
| **`pcc_eng_02_038.7814_x0611318_19:3-4-5`**     | There is nothing __``remotely funny``__ or interesting about " Mad Money , " the type of flick that coasts on such hoary cliches as people rolling around in cash and throwing it up in the air at every opportunity .                              |

| **`pcc_eng_16_080.3288_x1283871_3:26-28-29`**   | because atleast to me it looks like she 's legitimately retarded and aside from a few errors with her japanese / pronounciation there 's absolutely nothing even __``remotely funny``__ , even for someone who ' gets ' what she is talking about . |
