# _It's nothing too serious_: The Polarity Parallels and Pragmatic Potential of Partitioned Predicate Privation Postulated on Particulars of `Puddin`.

## Part I $=$ _What it is and (some of) what could be done with it_

### 1. Introduction

[_Leave for later._]

### 2. (_The Why_) Problems and Proposal: _Research Questions/Theory Informed Motivations for Corpus Creation_

- Why did I build the tool (=Puddin corpus and associated software/methods)? 
- What motivates it?
- How is it a contribution/what does it contribute? 
- What are examples of phenomena that the study of would benefit from having such a thing?
  - i.e. 👉 What could be done with it? 
- 📌 Overview of research questions _which will be the **basis of later chapters**_ 👇

### 3. (_The What_) Puddin and Processing: _Creation of Puddin and Corpus Analysis Tools and Methods_

- description
- creation process
- how to use, etc.
- 👉 How to do things with it

## Part II $=$ _What **I** did with it_

### _4. ❔ Partitioned/-ing Predicates: Adverb-Adjective Interaction and the Scalarity of Modification_

### _5. ❔ Privation of Partitions: Scalarity Interaction with Negation_

### _6. ❓ Pragmatic Potential: Inferential Ambiguity Resulting from Privation of Scalars_

> That is, the "thing" that negative polarity licensing "parallels" is this "pragmatic potential"
> (or the pragmatic ambiguity of competing implicatures based on scalar reasoning about privation
> of a portion of a scale).
> So it's kind of like: 
> 
> `Ch3 =` scalar predicate (ADVERB ADJECTIVE bigram)\
> `Ch4 =` negation/privation \
> `ChN =` polarity parallels \
> `Ch3 + Ch4 =` (results in) `pragmatic ambiguity` `||` (parallels/connection to) `ChN`
