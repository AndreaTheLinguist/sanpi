| **`pcc_eng_01_097.7344_x1563861_033:2-3-4`**    | While not __``terribly original``__ , I found these characters compelling .                                                                                                                                            |

| **`pcc_eng_25_014.7857_x0222916_145:3-4-5`**    | THERE is nothing __``terribly original``__ about Carrillo 's ideas .                                                                                                                                                   |

| **`pcc_eng_01_098.1773_x1571097_03:3-4-5`**     | There 's nothing __``terribly original``__ about the premise or plot of " Welcome to Your Authentic Indian Experience ( tm ) " by Rebecca Roanhorse , but do not mistake this observation for an unfriendly critique . |
| **`pcc_eng_15_041.1831_x0649752_08:12-13-14`**  | But we 're not hating on this at allsure it 's not __``terribly original``__ , but it works .                                                                                                                          |
