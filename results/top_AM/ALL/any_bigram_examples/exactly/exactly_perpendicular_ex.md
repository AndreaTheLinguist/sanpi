| **`pcc_eng_25_012.5579_x0187003_2:11-12`**     | The reason for this is the plane is flying almost __`exactly perpendicular`__ to the sun , so the contrail on the near side was in shadow .                                                                |

| **`pcc_eng_17_045.6612_x0721413_091:11-12`**   | The line of sight of the telescope needed to be __`exactly perpendicular`__ to the axis of rotation .                                                                                                      |
| **`pcc_eng_20_026.8413_x0417781_25:5-6`**      | The slot would be __`exactly perpendicular`__ to the lip at the back .                                                                                                                                     |
| **`pcc_eng_02_057.6308_x0916136_20:11-12`**    | These characteristics include flatness of the nozzles and nozzle array __`exactly perpendicular`__ to the axis , an optical polish , and edges of nozzles chip free and slightly rounded .                 |
| **`pcc_eng_02_047.4148_x0750907_36:32-33`**    | Ball drive 's three motors are configured as two motors in a standard tank drive ( one of the easiest drives to code ) , with an third motor which strafes __`exactly perpendicular`__ to the tank drive . |
| **`pcc_eng_06_068.5114_x1092382_26:20-21`**    | In this context , the rotation of the ground floor white volume is included in order to be located __`exactly perpendicular`__ to the south .                                                              |
| **`pcc_eng_09_090.4196_x1446791_29:12-14-15`** | But in many places on earth , the gravity vector may not be __`exactly perpendicular`__ to the reference ellipsoid .                                                                                       |
