| **`pcc_eng_04_100.5294_x1607944_09:3-4-5`**     | If youre not__``terribly fond``__of women , you probably shouldnt see Volver , a movie wherein mere mortality doesnt stop mothers from loudly smooching their daughters cheeks , a breezy comedy in which a seemingly typical male gets stabbed , stuffed into a fridge and buried at swamps edge .     |
| **`pcc_eng_27_006.6590_x0090971_08:1-2-3`**     | Not__``terribly fond``__of the greatful dead though .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **`pcc_eng_06_079.5061_x1269433_47:3-4-5`**     | I 'm not__``terribly fond``__of monkeys after a somewhat unfortunate and terrifying incident at a temple in Malaysia , but Davis was pretty excited to see them up close for the first time - that is until they started chasing & hissing at some kids - note to all - Monkey 's are not your friend ! |
