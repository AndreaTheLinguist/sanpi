This is a project to collect collocation frequencies of adv-adj pairs, weak NPIs, and strong NPIs under a variety of contexts. 

Scripts directory contains python code for running grew-match searches, process the hits (output as json files), and run statistical comparisons on the results.

The idea is that certain adv-adj pairs which are commonly used to create litotes will have similar distributions to strong NPIs, and perhaps have increased freqency in only a subset of contexts licensing weak NPIs. There is also a question whether certain kinds of adverbs will pattern even more strongly with certain context features than others, showing signs of semi-lexicalized usagae.

Corpus frequency data is derived from grew-match searches run on dependency annotated corpora (currently the New York Times, and soon the Associated Press)
