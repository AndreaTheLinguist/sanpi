Facebook redesigns Trending topics to make news easier to find

Facebook is introducing a couple of changes today that make it easier to spot trending topics and the coverage around them. First up, there's a bit of a visual redesign. Previously, clicking on a trending topic would highlight a story from one publication, and you'd have to scroll down past a live video section to view related stories. Facebook is replacing that system with a simple carousel, which does a better job of showing you different coverage options. To be clear, the change doesn't affect how stories are sourced, according to Facebook. It's still the same algorithm picking out some of the most...",Pile-CC,Pcc,"Wednesday, May 24, 2017

Because how do you get to Elrond when frozen and unable to move? Also, how would you make being frozen interesting for a player, especially when one is not able to do anything?

The one time my players encountered a basilisk, they managed not to get frozen. I would say that if a frozen character needed to get healing from Elrond, there would be a couple of options.

Hmm, he might not be frozen all at once. I would start by increasing the TN of all physical skills. Or he could also lose skill levels while frozen.

If the player has an Athletics skill of 3, it might temporarily drop to 2 when poisoned, then to 1 as the freezing kicks in, and eventually to a 0.

The cure is oddly specific. If the characters are in a Wilderland campaign and had never crossed over into Eriador, how would they know that Elrond has the cure? It could be managed, of course, but depending on how narrative arc, I might substitute Elrond with someone local, like Radagast.

Even Radagast isn't that local, given that the Wyrmholt is some 250 miles from Rhosgobel (Rivendell is strictly speaking closer though this requires crossing the Misty Mountains). It does mention Elrond in Rivendell specifically, but he need not be the only one who knows a cure. When my players past through the Wyrmholt on a diplomatic mission to the northern hillmen, the fought a nest of basilisk and one of them was poisoned and failed his Valour check.

He wanted the party to abandon the mission and return to Rhosgobel to have him cured, but a couple members of the Company argued (rightly, to my mind) that if there were locals in the area, they were likely to have a cure, or else they wouldn't be living near the Wyrmholt for very long... and it just so happens that Mab the Spinner lives at the edge of the Wyrmholt...

March 29, 2017 This post may contain affiliate links.

There is something super indulgent about carrot cake. I think it's because it's so heavy. You can feel its full of the good stuff. And, I'm not sure why, but it always seems to feel heavier after I bake it.

I never quite know whether to make it as a cake or a loaf. Same recipe. Different shape. And it makes a big difference. Especially to the kids. They are way more inclined to enjoy it if its shaped like a cake. Funny little things. Oh and if you sprinkle it with icing sugar. Well, then it's just ""the best carrot cake you've ever made, Mom"".

A couple things I would like to point out about this recipe:

It doesn't have any raisins or sultanas in it. It's a personal taste thing. For me. They just lose their appeal when added to baked goods. I will eat them if I have to, but if I'm cooking, I don't have to. They get all squishy, and soft ... Agh. Sends shivers down my spine. So no raisins. But feel free to add 1/4 cup if you really, really want to.

No Orange rind. Now if you have kids (which I'm assuming you do if you are reading this, you may notice that some of them don't like too many lumps or irregular textures in their food. You can put this down to picky eating and try and force this issue, but I have found that they grow out of this in time. So instead of orange rind I add orange juice. This seems to do the trick nicely to keep the loaf moist and sweet.

This is a seriously great versatile recipe that can be used as a cake (just bake in a round pan and top with a cream cheese icing) or as a loaf (serve in thick slices with butter) or as lunch box sized muffins (divide into 12 hole muffin tray and reduce cooking time to 12 -15 min)

It freezes beautifully.

And lastly, it's so flippin' easy. Carrot cake has a reputation of being hard work. I think it's got something to do with the thought of grating carrots?? This takes about 30 seconds and it's all down hill from there.",Pile-CC,Pcc,"Easy Carrot & Walnut Loaf

12,Pcc_pile-val_00012,"Hey folks - I tried to search the forums for help but didn't really find what I needed, so I apologize if this is a newbie duplication of an existing discussion.

I have a Breville Cafe Roma machine where I have swapped out the original pressurized filter basket for a non-pressurized Krups one, and I use a Baratza Virtuoso Preciso grinder.

My issue is this:Should there be grinds in the bottom of my espresso cup? I think I had some using the pressurized basket but maybe just a few fines, but this looks a bit excessive to me. There are some good-sized particles on the side of the cup and in the bottom, plus some fine dust-sized particles on the side of the cup. Shouldn't the filter basket be filtering the non-dust particles?

I am still experimenting with my grinder settings, but for those familiar with this, I am adjusting the macro usually around 11-13. Mark Prince's review recommends 11 for espresso and 12 for pressurized filter espresso. I have been trying coarser as it seems like my shots are running slow (like 28-30s for 2oz)

Here is a picture of the bottom of my cup after finishing my drink. Please advise - thanks in advance!

Doesn't look very appealing. Did you have some leakage at the top of the PF (ie, it wasn't screwed in tight enough)? If not, the fault is probably your filter basket - take a good look at it through light - are there excessively large holes along with smaller ones?

I do see minor (very minor) grounds in the bottom of many of my shots, but not this much.

To many fines/grounds left in the cup. Solution...follow Mark's advise for checking the pf and basket. If you don't see anything wrong there, double check your volume and extraction times...you should be pulling a 2 oz double in 25-27 seconds. If you're good on extraction time and volume...coursen the grind and increase the dose until you have minimized the appearance of fines in the bottom of the cup. Given your equipment, you probably won't be able to completely eliminate the appearance of fines...but you should be able to minimize them. Coursening the grind and increasing the dose should balance extraction time and volume while reducing fines. Since you're working with a step grinder...coursen the grind by one step and increase the dose by 1 g...pull a shot. If that shot runs 30 sec...coursen the grind one more step, but don't change the dose...pull another shot. If the shot runs like 35 sec, you might coursen the grind by two steps and leave the dose the same. I would continue this process checking shot time, volume, and the amount of fines left in the cup until you've minimized the fines. If you get back to the 2 oz in 25-27 sec mark and you still aren't happy with the amount of fines in the cup...increase the dose by another gram and start over with your grinder adjustments. I don't know for sure...but I would guess your max dose is probably somewhere between 17-19 grams...chances are, once you get to a dose of 19 g with a 2 oz extraction in 25-27 sec...whatever is left in the cup is probably as good as you're gonna get without upgrading equipment...particularly the grinder.

So to start here is what my filter basket looks like. (see first photo)

When held up to the light, it looks like all the holes are the same size. I think the photo amplifies the size of the holes, but they do look bigger than those on the original (pressurized) filter basket that came with the machine. (see second photo)

What do you think? Could it simply be that the Krups filter basket is letting them pass through?

With regards to the possibility of leaking around the portafilter, I have it locked into the machine pretty good and there is no signs of any liquid coming around and onto the sides.

It does look like the original basket has much smaller holes, which would make sense. I think you're using a pod basket. Larger holes, with the machine pressure ramped up into the 12 bar range to be pod compliant, you'll push loose grounds through. If you have access to a dremel tool, cut out the bottom layer of the original basket, leaving enough metal at the edges to support the inner layer. You'll most likely eliminate most of the grounds in the cup that way.Don't know the size of your p/f, but check into the Mr. Coffee double baskets, they're about 51 MM I think, and may fit your p/f.

I guess some others have found that the holes in this basket were too big for properly finely ground coffee. I notice that Breville USA (but not Canada) lists single wall / non pressurized filters on their website so I may look into these before I look for someone to drill my current basket

Well, to wrap this up, I managed to get a hold of the official Breville single wall filter baskets - got them from a local appliance shop in Chinatown for $20. The holes are definitely smaller than the Krups basket I had, and of the same size as the original Breville pressurized filters.

On my first attempt with these, I note that the leaking coffee grounds problem looks to be solved - excellent. I think that these filters will provide a great benefit over even that non-pressurized Krups one...

The grind setting I was using on my PReciso with the Krups basket to get a 25sec 2oz shot (with lots of leaking grinds) is a few clicks coarser than the suggested espresso setting. Keeping this setting, I just ran my first double shot with the Breville basket....and it blew through in 10 sec, hahaha. I think this is great because it must suggest that the Krups basket somehow by virtue of its tapered shape must have been providing some extra pressurizing. Now I can learn to improve my shot more without the influence of the basket adding pressure.

Here are the new baskets next to the old Krups one....an identical result to chopping off the bottom of a dual-wall filter for those of us without the skill or machine access to do so.

When you suggest upgrading his grinder as a posible solution, it implies that you find the Baratza Precisio to be substandard. According to all the reviews I have read, the Precisio is generally regarded as a fine espresso grinder.

I'm admittedly a newbie at this, but I like my Precisio better than the Rocky and I find little or no difference between the grind of the Precisio and my MACAP M4. If you find the Precisio to be substandard what about it is it that you do not like?

I guess some others have found that the holes in this basket were too big for properly finely ground coffee. I notice that Breville USA (but not Canada) lists single wall / non pressurized filters on their website so I may look into these before I look for someone to drill my current basket

Well, to wrap this up, I managed to get a hold of the official Breville single wall filter baskets - got them from a local appliance shop in Chinatown for $20. The holes are definitely smaller than the Krups basket I had, and of the same size as the original Breville pressurized filters.

On my first attempt with these, I note that the leaking coffee grounds problem looks to be solved - excellent. I think that these filters will provide a great benefit over even that non-pressurized Krups one...

The grind setting I was using on my PReciso with the Krups basket to get a 25sec 2oz shot (with lots of leaking grinds) is a few clicks coarser than the suggested espresso setting. Keeping this setting, I just ran my first double shot with the Breville basket....and it blew through in 10 sec, hahaha. I think this is great because it must suggest that the Krups basket somehow by virtue of its tapered shape must have been providing some extra pressurizing. Now I can learn to improve my shot more without the influence of the basket adding pressure.

Here are the new baskets next to the old Krups one....an identical result to chopping off the bottom of a dual-wall filter for those of us without the skill or machine access to do so.

When you suggest upgrading his grinder as a posible solution, it implies that you find the Baratza Precisio to be substandard. According to all the reviews I have read, the Precisio is generally regarded as a fine espresso grinder.

I'm admittedly a newbie at this, but I like my Precisio better than the Rocky and I find little or no difference between the grind of the Precisio and my MACAP M4. If you find the Precisio to be substandard what about it is it that you do not like?

Pantano hosts friends and supporters at Riverfest event on banks of the Cape Fear

PANTANO FAITHFUL CHEER ON THEIR FAVORITE IN NC/7 CONGRESSIONAL RACE

Conservative GOP congressional candidate Ilario Pantano with guests

By Verne Strickland / October 9, 2012

The invitation read:

Come out to Mike McCarley's beautiful riverside garden in Historic Downtown Wilmington to view the Invasion of the Pirates Flotilla and Fireworks on the Saturday night of Riverfest and get 'fired' up for Pantano for Congress.

The event lived up to its billing -- and then some. An estimated 125 guests turned up to cheer on their hero and favorite in what is certain to be a long and arduous struggle for the Seventh District seat in Congress -- a contest that won't be settled until November 2012.

Pantano led the group in prayer, then launched into a patriotic stump speech that pounced on liberal Democrats far and wide, promising that GOP stalwarts in North Carolina would be in the front ranks to rout them from their cushy incumbent lethargy.

A pulse-quickening display of fireworks flared brilliant against the night sky. The ""Pirate Flotilla"" arrived to the thunder of booming cannon. When the echoes faded, one person onshore --doubtless a Republican -- was heard to inquire: ""Is Obama the captain of this boat? He's a pirate isn't he?""

Then it was down to business. I interviewed candidate Ilario Pantano about his campaign and the Riverfest GOP spin-off:

VS: It's a beautiful night, and your supporters are obviously fired up. What is this event all about?

It's a celebration, and our chance to thank our growing ranks of supporters for all their hard work at the grassroots level. As I said, we've been building for seven months, and we have seven months to go. The heavy lifting starts now, and I say it matters. It matters more than ever. And I have a sense they all agree.

VS: Where are you now in your campaign?

We're actually at the halfway point in this drive for a primary victory. We started this campaign back in February, and we've been running hard for seven months. We now have seven months to go before the primary, and we're focused on that primary.

VS: You've always depended on strength and energy at the grassroots and precinct level. How is this ramping up?

What I will tell you is the support and the excitement in every county in this district is huge. And you know we have twelve counties in the Seventh now, and some of them are new. Even in these new counties, new friends are joining our cause, and are excited about what we represent. Because we are not the establishment, we're not business as usual. We are just somebody who loves their country, and have sacrificed for it time and time again, who understand how the economy works and how to create jobs. That combination is pretty important right now.

VS: Many in the political game just talk the talk. But you claim to walk the walk. What does that mean actually?

A lot of people can quote the policy all day long, but when you look to their life experience and understand their true motivations, and understand that their heart isn't a service heart, and what sacrifice really means, you have to wonder - do they know John 15:13? Do they really know? I am insistent on living out my faith, and this keeps me in a positive state of mind. I am really bullish on this country. What I see happening with this Occupy Wall Street movement is they want to replicate this right now. And this very desperate president wants to foment unrest throughout the country to shore up his chances in 2012. His game plan is a strategy of destruction. It is not in the best interest of the country. It's not good for my children or yours. I going to fight it and fight it hard.

Joe Agovino of Southport, long-time GOP leader in Brunswick County, was on hand at the GOP Riverfest celebration. He said conservative candidate Pantano has learned much from his experience in the political arena since his challenge to incumbent Mike McIntyre in the last congressional election.

VS: So you feel he has only gained strength and wisdom from being in the political arena?

That's right. I think Ilario has grown a great deal in the last year and a half. He's even more committed to serving his country. He has also learned a great deal about internal politics. I've been close to Ilario through the last campaign, and now this one. His commitment is genuine, and his loyalty is to his country, which he has served unselfishly.. In so doing, he has faced daunting challenges, but he has risen above all this, and has distinguished himself in many ways. So, today, I think he stands a better chance to win this primary because his supporters and the general public are comfortable with him and are really behind him.

VS: Ilario will face off in the GOP primary against State Senator David Rouzer of Johnston County. What do you expect from him as a candidate?

This race is a struggle between the old guard of the Republican Party and the newer members who are committed Constitutionalists and want to take our country back to work for the general well-being of the people. Mr. Rouzer is a bright young man, but is basically a Washington insider, and also a product of the system for a number of years. My personal opinion is that David Rouzer getting into this race will be good for Ilario, because of the stark contrast between the politician, David Rouzer, and the patriot, Ilario Pantano.

VS: You hang your hat in Brunswick County. How do you size up the conservative Republican base there?

In our county -- Brunswick -- we're seeing growth and strength at the precinct levels. That will be vital as Obama's paid volunteers flood into North Carolina with their liberal agenda. We intend to be ready.

What I'm seeing is more cohesiveness in the organization, and more motivation. I've been involved in politics for many years, and this is the earliest I've seen our Republican Party become involved in statewide or presidential elections in an off-election year. That's a tremendous plus. Our leadership is proactive and aggressive.We're putting the lessons we've learned to work for us on the road to 2012.",Pile-CC,Pcc,"USA Dot Com is a blog covering politics and government from a conservative Christian perspective.

The Dusseldorf School of painting had a big influence on 19th century landscape painting from the 1830s through the 1860s.

The school was notable for its dramatically lit historical subjects, often featuring scenes like shipwrecks, noble peasants, or epic mountainscapes.

The artists associated with the school include Wilhelm von Schadow, Karl Friedrich Lessing, the brothers Andreas and Oswald Achenbach, and Hans Fredrik Gude. Johann Wilhelm Schirmer is shown above. Some of them had experience painting theatrical backdrops, and they took some of those sensibilities into their easel paintings. Some of those pictorial features include:Realistic and detailed treatment of form.Strongest accents and focal point in middle ground.Dark framing masses at the sides of the compositions.Stormy skies and dramatic lighting.Road or trail leading into the picture.Filmy or atmospheric distances.Literary references in genre scenes.

Americans who studied there included George Caleb Bingham, Eastman Johnson, Worthington Whittredge, William Stanley Haseltine, James McDougal Hart, and William Morris Hunt, and Emanuel Leutze, who painted ""Washington Crossing the Delaware"" in Germany using American Dusseldorf students as models.

Although he wasn't formally enrolled at the academy, Albert Bierstadt worked and studied among the community of artists, and became probably the best exponent of the style. The Russian painter Ivan Shishkin also spent time there soaking up the landscape vocabulary.

Above: Oswald Achenbach, ""The Bay of Naples.""

The goal of the Dusseldorf artists was to infuse the landscape with ""stimmung"" (mood). Their romantic sensibilities were tied to ""Volkskarakter"" or national character. According to Henk Van Os,

""The idea is that the soul of a people is expressed through its countryside, its landscape; painters make this soul visible. This was to become the cornerstone of realistic landscape in the second half of the nineteenth century.""

Amazing that he created such an iconographic image without, presumably, having been there. (washing delware) how did he get GW's likeness? He didn't pose all the students at once... so how did get the light right (i am not asking for answers, its more to say, it just amazes me.) I am realist painter who wants to do historical subjects - and it can intimidating and also, there is this idea now that you need to be real... if for example you were painting the saraha, if you don't practically put the sand in your paint its not 'authentic'. I do believe it helps, immensely to experience the thing...but sometimes we do that we sacrofice our imagination

I, me: Leutze was an artist who was born in Germany, grew up in USA, and returned to live and work in Germany. When he painted WCD, he insisted on using Americans as models. Worthington Whittredge's memoir describes how he posed for Washington in an accurate costume, and also how Bierstadt arrived as a very unpromising hopeful, and then how he did miraculous stuff by just working his tail off outdoors.

Beautiful paintings, especially the first one. I love dynamic rocky forms like that, but I find them very difficult to paint, so seeing one so well executed is especially inspiring for me.

On an entirely unrelated note, James, I saw your cover painting for ""Citizen Phaid"" in a sci-fi art book the other day, and I was blown away. With all your dinosaurs and baby birds and horses and whatnot, it's easy for me to forget how adept you are at painting futuristic, high-tech subjects.

Thanks, Moai, that's really nice of you. The art director, Gene Mydlowski, deserves a lot of credit on that cover for letting me do a long horizontal composition, very atypical for covers in those days.

I saw the painting 'Cornel Rhos - Spring' by William Morris Hunt in the Pre-Raphaelites exhibition in Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. Many times. It was one of my absolute favourites in that show. Unfortunately I can't find a picture of it online..

Not that it's relevant, but ""Washington Crossing"" brings back memories of my visit to the Met and to a previous carrier where I visited J&J in Titusville NJ, at walking distance of the actual crossing location along the Delaware.But as I said, not really relevant.

I recall Frank Frazetta remarking in an interview that he wasn't very influenced by N.C. Wyeth, with whom he's sometimes compared, but rather by old German painters. He didn't identify the German painters, but looking at these works and the qualities James mentions (their strongest accents and focal point in middle ground, dark framing masses at the sides of the compositions, stormy skies and dramatic lighting, filmy or atmospheric distances), I wonder whether this was the group he meant.

I'm always kind of happy, whenn I read about german artists here at Your blog. Thank's for that! :-) The ""Dusseldorfer Malerschule"" for me (as a student at the ""Dusseldorfer Kunstakademie"") was and is a great inspiration, allthough ther weren't really outstanding painters. Only well informed people know the names of Andreas and Oswald Achenbach, for example. On the one side, their compositions were really impressive and their knowledge of how to make pictures look ""erhaben"" (means: impressive in an grand with a sense of awe) was astonishing. But they weren't great painters, if one looks at their ""brush-work"". No ""peinture"", if You know, what I mean.And they got with the ""Munchener Malerschule"" big competitors in the second half of the 19th century. Like Leibl or Bocklin, for example.

Nevertheless it's really worth the time to look at and examine the landscapes of the ""Dusseldorfer Malerschule"" protagonists. For example the two Achenwald brothers. The ""nordic"" Andreas Achenbach painted many norwayen landscapes with impressive clouds, storms, the expressive mountains and fjords ob the scandinavien countrys. His ""southern"" brother painted large italian landscapes, very warm, with red glowing imprimiturs. I prefer the nordish Achenbach, but that's just a matter of taste...

Perhaps You could write something about the ""Munchner Malerschule"" in the future? Some american ""impressionists"" like T.C. Steele, William Forsyth or Ottis Adams studied in Munich (together with famous german Painters like Lovis Corinth) and it's interesting to see, how their training/education in Germany influenced their work, when they returned to the USA.",Pile-CC,Pcc,"James Gurney

""The idea is that the soul of a people is expressed through its countryside, its landscape; painters make this soul visible. This was to become the cornerstone of realistic landscape in the second half of the nineteenth century.""

Amazing that he created such an iconographic image without, presumably, having been there. (washing delware) how did he get GW's likeness? He didn't pose all the students at once... so how did get the light right (i am not asking for answers, its more to say, it just amazes me.) I am realist painter who wants to do historical subjects - and it can intimidating and also, there is this idea now that you need to be real... if for example you were painting the saraha, if you don't practically put the sand in your paint its not 'authentic'. I do believe it helps, immensely to experience the thing...but sometimes we do that we sacrofice our imagination

I, me: Leutze was an artist who was born in Germany, grew up in USA, and returned to live and work in Germany. When he painted WCD, he insisted on using Americans as models. Worthington Whittredge's memoir describes how he posed for Washington in an accurate costume, and also how Bierstadt arrived as a very unpromising hopeful, and then how he did miraculous stuff by just working his tail off outdoors.

Beautiful paintings, especially the first one. I love dynamic rocky forms like that, but I find them very difficult to paint, so seeing one so well executed is especially inspiring for me.

On an entirely unrelated note, James, I saw your cover painting for ""Citizen Phaid"" in a sci-fi art book the other day, and I was blown away. With all your dinosaurs and baby birds and horses and whatnot, it's easy for me to forget how adept you are at painting futuristic, high-tech subjects.

Thanks, Moai, that's really nice of you. The art director, Gene Mydlowski, deserves a lot of credit on that cover for letting me do a long horizontal composition, very atypical for covers in those days.

I saw the painting 'Cornel Rhos - Spring' by William Morris Hunt in the Pre-Raphaelites exhibition in Nationalmuseum in Stockholm. Many times. It was one of my absolute favourites in that show. Unfortunately I can't find a picture of it online..

Not that it's relevant, but ""Washington Crossing"" brings back memories of my visit to the Met and to a previous carrier where I visited J&J in Titusville NJ, at walking distance of the actual crossing location along the Delaware.But as I said, not really relevant.

I recall Frank Frazetta remarking in an interview that he wasn't very influenced by N.C. Wyeth, with whom he's sometimes compared, but rather by old German painters. He didn't identify the German painters, but looking at these works and the qualities James mentions (their strongest accents and focal point in middle ground, dark framing masses at the sides of the compositions, stormy skies and dramatic lighting, filmy or atmospheric distances), I wonder whether this was the group he meant.

I'm always kind of happy, whenn I read about german artists here at Your blog. Thank's for that! :-) The ""Dusseldorfer Malerschule"" for me (as a student at the ""Dusseldorfer Kunstakademie"") was and is a great inspiration, allthough ther weren't really outstanding painters. Only well informed people know the names of Andreas and Oswald Achenbach, for example. On the one side, their compositions were really impressive and their knowledge of how to make pictures look ""erhaben"" (means: impressive in an grand with a sense of awe) was astonishing. But they weren't great painters, if one looks at their ""brush-work"". No ""peinture"", if You know, what I mean.And they got with the ""Munchener Malerschule"" big competitors in the second half of the 19th century. Like Leibl or Bocklin, for example.

Nevertheless it's really worth the time to look at and examine the landscapes of the ""Dusseldorfer Malerschule"" protagonists. For example the two Achenwald brothers. The ""nordic"" Andreas Achenbach painted many norwayen landscapes with impressive clouds, storms, the expressive mountains and fjords ob the scandinavien countrys. His ""southern"" brother painted large italian landscapes, very warm, with red glowing imprimiturs. I prefer the nordish Achenbach, but that's just a matter of taste...

Perhaps You could write something about the ""Munchner Malerschule"" in the future? Some american ""impressionists"" like T.C. Steele, William Forsyth or Ottis Adams studied in Munich (together with famous german Painters like Lovis Corinth) and it's interesting to see, how their training/education in Germany influenced their work, when they returned to the USA."

Shirdon, who was enrolled in the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology until at least 2012, appears in an ISIS video released two months ago.

Before burning his Canadian passport, Shirdon, in full view of the camera lens, issues a threat to Canada, the U.S. and ""all oppressors.""

""We are coming and we will destroy you by the will of God,"" Shirdon says on the video.

He comes from a prominent and well-educated Somali family. His father's brother, Abdi Farah Shirdon, was a former prime minister of Somalia who has survived numerous attempts on his life by al-Shabab militants fighting for an Islamic state in Somalia under the banner of al-Qaeda.

Shirdon's mother and sister live in Calgary and are deeply involved in the religious life of their community. CBC News reached out to them repeatedly, but they would only say they are ""confused and pained by Farah's choice,"" before asking for privacy.

Though it's unclear how real his threats are, Shirdon is the latest young man from Calgary to be identified by CBC News as a Canadian fighting overseas.

Hey, the guy's Somali so cut him a break. You weren't expecting much from him anyway were you?

He's from a people who couldn't be bothered to learn and remember their alleged ancient script so had to adopt the English Latin alphabet in the 1970s just to catch up with the rest of the world. How about that? Somalia didn't have a functioning alphabet until the late 20th century yet our immigration department thinks that somehow importing thousands of Somalis will enrich the country and give Canada a competitive edge on the world stage.

this is not left vs right, Tories vs Liberals, Socialism vs liberty. This is war against White people.

Why do hostile elite defend Israel as a Jewish ethnostate with Jewish only immigration, but ravage White majority Europe/North America into a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural Gulag with non-White colonization?

The world is 93% non-White, only 7% White. But 3rd world colonizers, Muslims, Punjabis, Chinese, are aggressively advancing their agenda to annihilate gullible Whites, just as China annihilates Tibet.

Pax, they don't even bother selecting the immigrants any more. They must have stopped selecting them in the late 1980's. Every time I visit Toronto and environs, I see tonnes of morbidly obese blacks from the Caribbean, elderly Hindus and Sikhs from India, Somali Muslims and other vile, diseased trash from the third world. It's like they're scooping them up and dumping them here, as if Canada were some kind of dumping ground for the third world. And these people are supposed to take over Canada in the next 2 or 3 decades. It's embarrassing! Looks like a third world Canada is in the works.

Either we stop all third world immigration NOW or we're all immigrating to some place in eastern Europe in the next 10 or 20 years. Heaven help us all!

We don't attract the best and brightest. This should be obvious to anyone who lives in a major Canadian city. When the Philippines tops the list of source countries it's clear you don't seem to give a shit anymore. All that matters now is that they vote for you political party and can carry a mortgage.

can you delete my comments and the reply threads ,from this post and the previous post.

Fine.

But you're going to have to tell me which anon is you.

If you're the anon trying to excuse non-Europeans of the crime of native land theft then I can understand why because deep down you have no argument.

He comes from a prominent and well-educated Somali family. His father's brother, Abdi Farah Shirdon, was a former prime minister of Somalia who has survived numerous attempts on his life by al-Shabab militants fighting for an Islamic state in Somalia under the banner of al-Qaeda.

Shirdon's mother and sister live in Calgary and are deeply involved in the religious life of their community. CBC News reached out to them repeatedly, but they would only say they are ""confused and pained by Farah's choice,"" before asking for privacy.

Though it's unclear how real his threats are, Shirdon is the latest young man from Calgary to be identified by CBC News as a Canadian fighting overseas.

Hey, the guy's Somali so cut him a break. You weren't expecting much from him anyway were you?

He's from a people who couldn't be bothered to learn and remember their alleged ancient script so had to adopt the English Latin alphabet in the 1970s just to catch up with the rest of the world. How about that? Somalia didn't have a functioning alphabet until the late 20th century yet our immigration department thinks that somehow importing thousands of Somalis will enrich the country and give Canada a competitive edge on the world stage.

this is not left vs right, Tories vs Liberals, Socialism vs liberty. This is war against White people.

Why do hostile elite defend Israel as a Jewish ethnostate with Jewish only immigration, but ravage White majority Europe/North America into a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural Gulag with non-White colonization?

The world is 93% non-White, only 7% White. But 3rd world colonizers, Muslims, Punjabis, Chinese, are aggressively advancing their agenda to annihilate gullible Whites, just as China annihilates Tibet.

Pax, they don't even bother selecting the immigrants any more. They must have stopped selecting them in the late 1980's. Every time I visit Toronto and environs, I see tonnes of morbidly obese blacks from the Caribbean, elderly Hindus and Sikhs from India, Somali Muslims and other vile, diseased trash from the third world. It's like they're scooping them up and dumping them here, as if Canada were some kind of dumping ground for the third world. And these people are supposed to take over Canada in the next 2 or 3 decades. It's embarrassing! Looks like a third world Canada is in the works.

Either we stop all third world immigration NOW or we're all immigrating to some place in eastern Europe in the next 10 or 20 years. Heaven help us all!

We don't attract the best and brightest. This should be obvious to anyone who lives in a major Canadian city. When the Philippines tops the list of source countries it's clear you don't seem to give a shit anymore. All that matters now is that they vote for you political party and can carry a mortgage.

can you delete my comments and the reply threads ,from this post and the previous post.

Fine.

But you're going to have to tell me which anon is you.

If you're the anon trying to excuse non-Europeans of the crime of native land theft then I can understand why because deep down you have no argument. If Europeans are imperialist land thieves then so are non-Europeans right down to their modern day Canadian born descendants."

AMSTERDAM, Netherlands -- Tens of thousands of mourners threw flowers, wept and chanted the name of Pim Fortuyn on Friday as the body of the slain politician was driven in a hearse to his funeral.

The peal of church bells in Rotterdam was drowned out as crowds roared when Fortuyn's remains were carried out of the 16th-century Laurentius and Elisabeth Cathedral after a Roman Catholic Mass broadcast on television.

The atmosphere of the procession was at times more like a sporting event or a mass protest than a solemn funeral cortege, with thousands of people raising their hands in the air, chanting ""Pim Fortuyn, Pim Fortuyn,"" and singing ""You'll Never Walk Alone,"" a support song for the Rotterdam soccer team.

The outpouring of public sentiment could effect voters next week in elections for a new government. Before his death, Fortuyn's populist, anti-immigration party ranked among the top three parties, and seemed to have gathered strength since his assassination on Monday.

Meanwhile in Amsterdam, prosecutors indicated Fortuyn's suspected killer may have been plotting against three other members of his anti-immigration party.

The names of the party members and maps of their neighborhoods were found in the suspect's car, said a spokeswoman for the pubic prosecutor. The identities of the targeted members were not released.

An inviting grave

Call me weird, but sometimes, when I want to take a little break from the rush, I take a walk in one of the many cemeteries that we have inside Paris. And for the first time in my life I visited the one of Montmartre, right at the bottom of the ""Butte"", near the Place de Clichy. A very interesting one, with many famous people. I took a few photos while I was walking without knowing exactly whose grave I was taking. It's only when I came back home that I discovered that I had taken the tomb of a famous French actor who died recently: Jean-Claude Brialy.

The Paris cemeteries amaze me. Ours do not intrigue so because they are not dominated by above-ground crypts. (New Orleans is an exception, but they are dangerous due to violent criminals robbing people.)

Your cemeteries are historical and artistic journeys. I recommend buying a guide to find the famous people. I've not walked the Montmartre one, but I would like to.

By the way, I love the photo of the Opera yesterday. It reminds me of escorting a certain English/Brazilian person back to her safe house after our PDP dinner. We emerged from the Metro and bang! there was Opera Garnier at night. Always stunning at night, no matter what colors.

beautiful grave, if appropriate to say. I liked J-C Brialy, saw many old films (black and white) with him. You are not weird Eric, I know many people who like to walk or just sit on cemetaries just because they are so quiet and peaceful.

I love the almost closed eyes. Modest and soft tone. Walking in cemetaries surely helps to think about the very quintessence of life! Sometimes we just feel like it has to be thought a little about! I do not think you are weird nor even that your title is. An inviting grave to keep in mind all our remembers and to feel the way ahead. The way to meet new people, to simply look peacefully at our environment, animals, trees, dead leaves, snow, and then the yellow, the blue, the red, etc... The way to forget all and any disagreable parts. The way between those who sound really happy and those who sound less. And the truth behind that...Flore

You're not weird. Sometimes I go to cemetaries to get away and to think. For me, It's an escape to another time and place. I read the dates of birth and death, the names of the dead and try to imagine what their lives were like. For some people, it's the only remaining trace of their existence and I like to think that for the few minutes that I spend at their grave wondering about them, I'm somehow keeping their story alive. That's WEIRD!!!

Beautiful shot. If wandering in cemeteries is weird, I'm a weirdo too.

Happy Thanksgiving to all the PDPers who are celebrating today. I will be giving thanks for the talent and dedication of Mr. Eric Tenin, who makes every day of the year special for me with his wonderful photos.

Need to sell your home fast? Hire a professional interior designer

24th April 2018

0 Comment(s)

Whether you've just bought a new property, or are planning on selling, designing and decorating a whole home can be a mammoth task. Where do you start? What colours should you go for? And what fabrics will look fantastic? Most of all, how much will it all cost?

Hiring an interior designer can give you the talent, experience and perspective you need to help save you time, effort and money. From a resale point of view, homes that have had the touch of a talented professional are generally more attractive and easier to sell.

Brands spend thousands of pounds trying to get the right look and feel for their products. Whole teams are dedicated to this process, from the product development and packaging design right through to the marketing. When your home is likely to be one of your biggest investments, it makes sense that your approach should be the same.

At Mood Interiors, we believe that hiring a professional interior designer can help sell your home for a higher price and more quickly. Here's why:

Boost your home's appeal

In America, many home sellers realise the value of investing in interior design before they put their house up for sale. However, in the UK, this isn't necessarily the case. It only takes a quick glance at the online property portals to see lots of dreary houses for sale. Many of them are poorly decorated, unstyled and photographed in a bad light. An interior designer can make your home stand out from the crowd and cause people to stand up and take notice when they spot it for sale. What's more, when they come to view, they won't be disappointed.

Accentuate the benefits

Interior designers can work the space available to the best of its ability and are likely to spot plus points you might not have noticed. This will allow you to accentuate every benefit your property offers and potentially ask a higher price.

Create a coherent home

A house that is a mishmash of styles, furniture and colours can be jarring on the eye and turn buyers off. That's why before putting it on the market, it's important to ensure that everything in your home flows together seamlessly. An interior designer can help you use styles, colours and patterns to help achieve this.

Fetch a higher price

It might sound odd, but the phrase 'spend money to make money' rings true when it comes to employing an interior designer to help sell your home. Not only will they be able to frame your home in the best light possible, they're likely to increase its perceived value. Overall, you're likely to see a real return on investment that pays the interior designer fee many times over.

Create a more universal look

As a home owner, it's easy to get caught up in the interiors that you love and suit your personality. But naturally, not all people will feel the same about your baroque wallpaper or family photo wall.

Good interior designers aren't just skilled in creating interiors that suit your personality, they also have a knack for styling homes in a universally appealing way. Because you never know what people will like or dislike, this ability to create a show home vibe can be highly valuable and significantly broaden your pool of potential purchasers.

At Mood Interiors, we help people like you frame your home in the best light possible - whether you're selling or staying put.

Created on Friday, 16 January 2015 00:00 | Written by Joe Robertson |

For decades, medical research  and the cures and treatments it has discovered  have meant hope for millions of American living with disease and disability. But in recent years, those hopes have been clouded as Congress continues to significantly underfund the National Institutes of Health.

The funding agreement for the 2015 fiscal year that Congress approved recently does little to improve the situation. The agreement appropriately includes a boost in funding for Ebola research, but it provides only a small increase in funding for the rest of the NIHs budget  which was cut by a disabling $1.7

billion two years ago and has been largely flat over the past 10 years. The small increase for 2015  about one-half of 1 percent  wont allow NIH funding to even keep pace with inflation.

All of us associated with Oregon Health & Science University  health care providers, scientists and patients  are relieved that Congress at least avoided a government shutdown in approving the agreement. But we are disappointed that the spending bill fails to adequately fund the lifesaving research the NIH supports. And we will continue to call on Congress to fund the NIH appropriately, and give U.S. medical researchers the support they need to lead the world.

For nearly 70 years, the nations research investment through the NIH has improved our understanding of the causes of disease, increased life expectancy, and enhanced the health and well-being of Americans everywhere. Every day, health care professionals and scientists throughout the nation, including at OHSU, see the hope that medical research brings.

NIH-funded research has led to a decline of more than 60 percent in deaths from heart disease and stroke. NIH-supported advances also have led to a test to predict breast cancer recurrence, the discovery of genetic markers for complex illnesses, improved asthma treatments, and the near-elimination of HIV transmission between mother and child.

At OHSU, NIH funding has allowed us to make medical and scientific breakthroughs in cancer, stem cell research and infectious diseases, among many other areas. With funding from the NIH, Brian Druker, director of the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute, helped develop Gleevec, a breakthrough drug for chronic myeloid leukemia that also served as proof that targeted cancer treatment could work.

Patients who once were expected to live three to five years now have a normal life expectancy because of the drug.

In recent years, other OHSU scientists have used NIH funding to make significant advances in the quest to employ stem cells to cure disease, in uncovering the epigenetic basis for chronic diseases, and in developing a vaccine that may someday wipe out HIV infection from the body.

Rebuilding the NIH budget also would be good for our countrys fiscal health. The research funded by NIH that mostly occurs at our nations medical schools and teaching hospitals creates skilled jobs, new products, and improved technologies. In 2012, NIH-funded research supported more than 400,000 jobs across the country.

Last year, the federal government provided OHSU scientists with $272 million in support for medical research, including $232 million from the NIH. That money not only helps our scientists continually make advances in treating and curing disease, it also provides a significant economic impact for the state of Oregon  an economic impact that was measured at more than $600 million for the 2009 fiscal year. The economic impact is undoubtedly larger today.

But this issue is about much more than economic impact, of course. This issue is about treating disease, curing disease  and providing hope.

How Can You Avoid Being Scammed by a Mover?

How do you pick the right mover, especially when the industry is known for discreditable
companies looking to scam their next customer? Avoid being the next victim of a
disreputable mover by learning the tricks of these fraudulent companies and educating
yourself on the smart way to choose a reputable mover in your area.

The Today Show recently featured a segment on ""How to Avoid Being Scammed by
movers."" In order to avoid these scams, it's critical that you know how to
spot them. Get to know the top scams that can be attempted by a mover as identified
by The Today Show:

The Hostage

Bait and Switch

Trumped Up Delivery Charges

Late (or Never) Delivery

Reckless Abandonment

Now that you are familiar with the nicknames of common moving scams, let's go into
detail about what each of these terms mean. The Today Show segment explained the
way a disreputable mover gets away with these popular scams as follows:

The Hostage:

A mover provides you with an estimate, only to add extras on once they have your
belongings in their possession. Basically, their estimate is not valid, and they
can tack on as many additional costs as they'd like - doubling or tripling the
cost of your move. If you want your furniture back, you have to conceded
and pay the additional cost.

Bait and Switch:

A mover will provide you with an estimate for the cost of your move, and then switch
this arranged deal at the last minute. They sell you on a low price, but in the
end, the cost of your move ends up being nothing close to what you agreed to.

Trumped
Up Delivery Charges:

A mover will tack on additional charges based on unfounded reasons. Say the mover
gave you an estimate based on weight. After your valuables are on their truck, they
then charge you extra claiming the cubic feet have exceeded the weight estimate
of your goods. Since this is impossible to calculate, you're stuck paying the
fees or forsaking your goods.

Other common trumped up charges include saying packing was not included in your
estimate, charging more because your goods weren't totally packed and ready for
the move and so on.

Late (or Never)
Delivery:

This scam may be the worst of the bunch. A mover will come and pack, load and promise
to deliver your belongings ""on-time."" Then, they call saying your goods
are in the back of a truck behind two other peoples' belongings, so you can't receive
your furniture until theirs is delivered first.

Or, if the mover has a licensing violation and their truck is impounded in transit
by the Department of Transportation, all your valuables are stuck on board until
the truck is released. Either of these situations result in your goods being
delivered weeks late...or not at all.

Reckless Abandonment:

This happens often with a rogue mover. A fly by the night mover will take your money,
load your belongings, then close up shop and flee, abandoning your shipment either
on the truck or in a private storage facility. This scam allows the mover to take
off with your money and your belongings. If you are lucky enough to find where
your belongings ended up, expect to pay exorbitant amounts of money to retrieve
them from the storage locale.

Don't Fall Into the Traps Set by a Disreputable Mover!

So, now that you know the common rip-offs and scams executed by a shady mover, how
can you avoid these common pitfalls many individuals and families fall into when
moving? Do not despair; not all movers are despicable. Having a successful, affordable
relocation performed by a professional mover does not have to be a pipe dream. Below
are some tips for choosing a mover for a happy, successful relocation:

Check the Company's Address: A REAL mover will have a REAL address.
Once you get the address, make sure you Google it or drive to the location to verify
its legitimacy.

Ask for Recommendations from Friends, Family and Neighbors: One
of the best ways to find a great mover? Word of mouth from people they have moved
before.

Ask your Real Estate Agent: Real estate agents help people move
all the time. They are a great source for a reputable mover.

Get Three Competitive In-Home Estimates: Get three estimates from
three different moving companies. If there is a significant disparity, this will
help you to easily identify a fraud.

Choose a mover who Bases Price off Weight, Not Cubic Feet: This
will help guarantee and lock in the estimate they provide you initially.

Check the mover's Complaint History: If a mover has more than eight
complaints on a given complaint website (Better Business Bureau, etc.), then you
might want to rethink electing them as your mover.

How to Protect Yourself from a Mover's Scams

There are some simple steps you can take to prevent falling into scams with a mover,
and certain things you should never do when moving. Heed this advice,
and benefit from a happier (and cheaper) move:

Don't Fall for a Front Company: Double check that the mover has
a real address, and is not just some rogue mover representing its website as an
actual business.

Do Not Give a Deposit: A mover that demands a deposit upfront likely
has an agenda other than securely moving your belongings - like taking your money
and running. If a mover demands a deposit, move on to a different company.

Do NOT Pay Cash: Paying cash is asking for trouble. When you pay
cash, there is no evidence of a transaction. Therefore, if your things aren't moved,
or even worse, you don't get them back, you have no evidence of ever having paid
for service.

Make Sure the Truck is Branded: Real moving companies have real
moving trucks, complete with branding and logos. To make sure crooks do not drive
off with your valuables, check the truck for a company logo.

Do Not Sign a Partial Contract: You would never sign a loan agreement,
pre-nup or binding contract of other sorts with blanks; the same rule applies for
moving contracts. Make sure the contract is complete and all filled in before signing
anything.

Do Not Agree to a Skinny Contract: Make sure you sign a complete
moving contract, or one that is more than two pages. All of your goods should be
listed on the contract.

Buy Extra Insurance: A reputable mover will offer additional types
of moving insurance to ensure you can have the highest protection should something
happen to your valuables during the move. Allied Van Lines offers Full Valuation
Coverage that totally protects your shipment should damage or loss occur.

Ask About the Mover's Claims Policy:
Find out more about how the company processes claims in the event you should need
to file one. Should you file a claim, you want to make sure it is handled quickly
and properly.

You Deserve a Great Relocation Experience with a Professional Mover

Everyone should be entitled to a secure, sound relocation at a fair price. By knowing
the common scams carried out by a mover, using the tips to selecting a reputable
mover and avoiding the things NOT to do during your move, you too, can enjoy a hassle-free,
economic move experience. Use these three checklists and the valuable information
provided by contributors on The Today Show to avoid common moving scams, saving
you money and headaches.

Allied Van Lines - Your Choice for a Reputable, Professional Mover

Allied wants you to know that moving does not have to be overwhelming. Now, more
than ever, we believe people should be able to have a professional mover handle
their relocation while still receiving a fair price. Begin by allowing yourself
plenty of time to move, and Allied can help you get organized regarding the rest.

Choosing a Reputable Mover: How To

Today's economic climate is anything but certain. Foreclosures are upwards of 30%,
and people are being smarter, and more conscious, about where their money is going.
People who are not relishing in this economic downturn are the most likely to become
victims of moving scams. They search for the mover with the best price, not knowing
that these ""too good to be true"" movers often are.

With more than 85 years of experience in the moving business, Allied Van Lines knows
the ins and outs of the industry. And, since we are a reputable moving
company, we can tell you exactly how to choose a professional mover. We know you
want a great move at a fair price. Here are some tips on how to choose a mover
who can provide you with just that:

Begin the search for the perfect mover 8 weeks prior to your move.
If you aren't lucky enough to have that much time, start as soon as possible.

Ask for references. Check with others around you who have recently
moved for their recommendations on a great mover.

Make a list of the services you need. Be sure to consider everything,
from temporary storage to shipping your car to ensure you get the most accurate
price, and more importantly, choose a mover who can accommodate your needs.

Research companies thoroughly. Look for companies in your area
that can provide the specific services you need. Eliminate those companies that
do not meet your requirements.

Get multiple in-home estimates. Make sure the estimate is done
at your home, and have multiple companies perform them to compare costs.

Use these helpful tips to help find the best mover. Just Remember: Cheapest
is not always best. What may seem like a great deal upfront can actually
end up costing you MUCH more in the end.

Now that you know how to start the search for a superior mover, here are some
tips on what to look for in a reputable mover:

The mover's credentials: Make sure the mover is licensed, insured
and bonded; registered with the Department of Transportation; check its standing
with the Better Business Bureau; check to make sure its address is legitimate.

A physical address: Visit the company's location or double-check
that their address is valid on the internet.

Branded trucks and uniformed men: If a plain, rental looking truck
shows up at your door, be wary.

Clean complaint history: Asking for a spotless complaint history
may be excessive, but make sure there is not too much negative press about the company.

Bill of Lading and Rights and Responsibilities: A reputable mover
will give you a Bill of Lading and your Rights and Responsibilities. You are entitled
to these documents and a copy of your contract during your move. If your mover is
professional, you will receive copies of these documents.

Finding a Mover is Easy When You Know What to Look For... and What to Avoid

Now, you're educated about moving scams thanks to The Today Show's segment ""How
to Avoid Being Scammed by movers,"" and you have nearly fail-proof tips to choosing
the right mover and being protected during the move.

Arm yourself with these tips to avoid being scammed by a mover! Don't make a relocation

How Can You Avoid Being Scammed by a Mover?

How do you pick the right mover, especially when the industry is known for discreditable
companies looking to scam their next customer? Avoid being the next victim of a
disreputable mover by learning the tricks of these fraudulent companies and educating
yourself on the smart way to choose a reputable mover in your area.

The Today Show recently featured a segment on ""How to Avoid Being Scammed by
movers."" In order to avoid these scams, it's critical that you know how to
spot them. Get to know the top scams that can be attempted by a mover as identified
by The Today Show:

The Hostage

Bait and Switch

Trumped Up Delivery Charges

Late (or Never) Delivery

Reckless Abandonment

Now that you are familiar with the nicknames of common moving scams, let's go into
detail about what each of these terms mean. The Today Show segment explained the
way a disreputable mover gets away with these popular scams as follows:

The Hostage:

A mover provides you with an estimate, only to add extras on once they have your
belongings in their possession. Basically, their estimate is not valid, and they
can tack on as many additional costs as they'd like - doubling or tripling the
cost of your move. If you want your furniture back, you have to conceded
and pay the additional cost.

Bait and Switch:

A mover will provide you with an estimate for the cost of your move, and then switch
this arranged deal at the last minute. They sell you on a low price, but in the
end, the cost of your move ends up being nothing close to what you agreed to.

Trumped
Up Delivery Charges:

A mover will tack on additional charges based on unfounded reasons. Say the mover
gave you an estimate based on weight. After your valuables are on their truck, they
then charge you extra claiming the cubic feet have exceeded the weight estimate
of your goods. Since this is impossible to calculate, you're stuck paying the
fees or forsaking your goods.

Other common trumped up charges include saying packing was not included in your
estimate, charging more because your goods weren't totally packed and ready for
the move and so on.

Late (or Never)
Delivery:

This scam may be the worst of the bunch. A mover will come and pack, load and promise
to deliver your belongings ""on-time."" Then, they call saying your goods
are in the back of a truck behind two other peoples' belongings, so you can't receive
your furniture until theirs is delivered first.

Or, if the mover has a licensing violation and their truck is impounded in transit
by the Department of Transportation, all your valuables are stuck on board until
the truck is released. Either of these situations result in your goods being
delivered weeks late...or not at all.

Reckless Abandonment:

This happens often with a rogue mover. A fly by the night mover will take your money,
load your belongings, then close up shop and flee, abandoning your shipment either
on the truck or in a private storage facility. This scam allows the mover to take
off with your money and your belongings. If you are lucky enough to find where
your belongings ended up, expect to pay exorbitant amounts of money to retrieve
them from the storage locale.

Don't Fall Into the Traps Set by a Disreputable Mover!

So, now that you know the common rip-offs and scams executed by a shady mover, how
can you avoid these common pitfalls many individuals and families fall into when
moving? Do not despair; not all movers are despicable. Having a successful, affordable
relocation performed by a professional mover does not have to be a pipe dream. Below
are some tips for choosing a mover for a happy, successful relocation:

Check the Company's Address: A REAL mover will have a REAL address.
Once you get the address, make sure you Google it or drive to the location to verify
its legitimacy.

Ask for Recommendations from Friends, Family and Neighbors: One
of the best ways to find a great mover? Word of mouth from people they have moved
before.

Ask your Real Estate Agent: Real estate agents help people move
all the time. They are a great source for a reputable mover.

Get Three Competitive In-Home Estimates: Get three estimates from
three different moving companies. If there is a significant disparity, this will
help you to easily identify a fraud.

Choose a mover who Bases Price off Weight, Not Cubic Feet: This
will help guarantee and lock in the estimate they provide you initially.

Check the mover's Complaint History: If a mover has more than eight
complaints on a given complaint website (Better Business Bureau, etc.), then you
might want to rethink electing them as your mover.

How to Protect Yourself from a Mover's Scams

There are some simple steps you can take to prevent falling into scams with a mover,
and certain things you should never do when moving. Heed this advice,
and benefit from a happier (and cheaper) move:

Don't Fall for a Front Company: Double check that the mover has
a real address, and is not just some rogue mover representing its website as an
actual business.

Do Not Give a Deposit: A mover that demands a deposit upfront likely
has an agenda other than securely moving your belongings - like taking your money
and running. If a mover demands a deposit, move on to a different company.

Do NOT Pay Cash: Paying cash is asking for trouble. When you pay
cash, there is no evidence of a transaction. Therefore, if your things aren't moved,
or even worse, you don't get them back, you have no evidence of ever having paid
for service.

Make Sure the Truck is Branded: Real moving companies have real
moving trucks, complete with branding and logos. To make sure crooks do not drive
off with your valuables, check the truck for a company logo.

Do Not Sign a Partial Contract: You would never sign a loan agreement,
pre-nup or binding contract of other sorts with blanks; the same rule applies for
moving contracts. Make sure the contract is complete and all filled in before signing
anything.

Do Not Agree to a Skinny Contract: Make sure you sign a complete
moving contract, or one that is more than two pages. All of your goods should be
listed on the contract.

Buy Extra Insurance: A reputable mover will offer additional types
of moving insurance to ensure you can have the highest protection should something
happen to your valuables during the move. Allied Van Lines offers Full Valuation
Coverage that totally protects your shipment should damage or loss occur.

Ask About the Mover's Claims Policy:
Find out more about how the company processes claims in the event you should need
to file one. Should you file a claim, you want to make sure it is handled quickly
and properly.

You Deserve a Great Relocation Experience with a Professional Mover

Everyone should be entitled to a secure, sound relocation at a fair price. By knowing
the common scams carried out by a mover, using the tips to selecting a reputable
mover and avoiding the things NOT to do during your move, you too, can enjoy a hassle-free,
economic move experience. Use these three checklists and the valuable information
provided by contributors on The Today Show to avoid common moving scams, saving
you money and headaches.

Allied Van Lines - Your Choice for a Reputable, Professional Mover

Allied wants you to know that moving does not have to be overwhelming. Now, more
than ever, we believe people should be able to have a professional mover handle
their relocation while still receiving a fair price. Begin by allowing yourself
plenty of time to move, and Allied can help you get organized regarding the rest.

Choosing a Reputable Mover: How To

Today's economic climate is anything but certain. Foreclosures are upwards of 30%,
and people are being smarter, and more conscious, about where their money is going.
People who are not relishing in this economic downturn are the most likely to become
victims of moving scams. They search for the mover with the best price, not knowing
that these ""too good to be true"" movers often are.

With more than 85 years of experience in the moving business, Allied Van Lines knows
the ins and outs of the industry. And, since we are a reputable moving
company, we can tell you exactly how to choose a professional mover. We know you
want a great move at a fair price. Here are some tips on how to choose a mover
who can provide you with just that:

Begin the search for the perfect mover 8 weeks prior to your move.
If you aren't lucky enough to have that much time, start as soon as possible.

Ask for references. Check with others around you who have recently
moved for their recommendations on a great mover.

Make a list of the services you need. Be sure to consider everything,
from temporary storage to shipping your car to ensure you get the most accurate
price, and more importantly, choose a mover who can accommodate your needs.

Research companies thoroughly. Look for companies in your area
that can provide the specific services you need. Eliminate those companies that
do not meet your requirements.

Get multiple in-home estimates. Make sure the estimate is done
at your home, and have multiple companies perform them to compare costs.

Use these helpful tips to help find the best mover. Just Remember: Cheapest
is not always best. What may seem like a great deal upfront can actually
end up costing you MUCH more in the end.

Now that you know how to start the search for a superior mover, here are some
tips on what to look for in a reputable mover:

The mover's credentials: Make sure the mover is licensed, insured
and bonded; registered with the Department of Transportation; check its standing
with the Better Business Bureau; check to make sure its address is legitimate.

A physical address: Visit the company's location or double-check
that their address is valid on the internet.

Branded trucks and uniformed men: If a plain, rental looking truck
shows up at your door, be wary.

Clean complaint history: Asking for a spotless complaint history
may be excessive, but make sure there is not too much negative press about the company.

Bill of Lading and Rights and Responsibilities: A reputable mover
will give you a Bill of Lading and your Rights and Responsibilities. You are entitled
to these documents and a copy of your contract during your move. If your mover is
professional, you will receive copies of these documents.

Finding a Mover is Easy When You Know What to Look For... and What to Avoid

Now, you're educated about moving scams thanks to The Today Show's segment ""How
to Avoid Being Scammed by movers,"" and you have nearly fail-proof tips to choosing
the right mover and being protected during the move.

41,Pcc_pile-val_00041,"Understanding Physically Based Rendering in Arnold

Designing materials based on physical laws can tremendously simplify shading and lighting, even when we do not necessarily strive for realism or physical accuracy. By understanding and applying a few principles, we can make images that are more believable, and create materials that behave more predictably in different lighting setups.

In modern renderers, physically based rendering refers to concepts like energy conservation, physically plausible scattering and layering in materials and linear color spaces. Arnold is a physically based renderer, but it also lets you break the rules and create materials and lights that do not obey the laws of physics if you wish. In this document, we'll explain the underlying theory and how to set up your shaders to follow these principles.

In rendering we simulate photons emitted from lights, traveling through the air and bouncing off surfaces and through volumes, eventually ending up on a camera sensor. The combination of millions of photons on the camera sensor then forms the rendered image.

This means that from a physics point of view, surface shaders describe how the surface interacts with photons. Photons hitting an object can be absorbed, reflect off the surface, refract through the surface, or scatter around inside the object. The combination of these components results in a wide variety of materials.

Energy Conservation

Unless an object is a light source that emits photons, it can't return more energy than is being contributed by the incoming light. For a material to be energy conserving the number of photons leaving the surface should be smaller or equal to the number of incoming photons. If a material is not energy conserving, materials will appear overly bright and render with increased noise, especially when using global illumination.

To keep materials energy conserving, the weight and color of material components should never exceed 1. Further, we must be careful to ensure that the combination of all components is energy conserving, which we'll explain in detail later.

Materials

At the microscopic level, object surfaces are intricately detailed. For rendering, we do not use geometry to represent all of this detail, but rather use statistical models than having easy to understand parameters.

Arnold's StandardSurface shadermodel objects with one or two specular layers, and a diffuse or transparent interior. This model can represent a wide variety of materials. Let's look at the individual components.

Diffuse and Subsurface Scattering

First, consider the diffuse interior. Incoming photons will enter the object, scatter around inside and either get absorbed or leave the object at another location.

If photons scatter many times, we get a diffuse appearance, due to photons leaving the surface in many different locations and directions. For materials like skin, photons can scatter relatively far under the surface giving a very soft appearance, which we render with subsurface scattering. For materials like unfinished wood, photons do not scatter very far which gives a harder appearance, and we render these as diffuse. For thin objects like leaves, the photons can scatter all the way to the other side of the object, which we render as diffuse SSS with thin_wall enabled.

Note that fundamentally all of these types of materials have the same underlying physical mechanism, even though we provide separate controls for them in the shader.

The diffuse interior also typically has the biggest influence on the overall color of the material. Each photon has an associated wavelength, and depending on the properties of the material some photons with some wavelengths are more likely to be absorbed than others. This, in turn, means that photons with some wavelengths are more likely to leave the surface, which will give it a colored appearance.

The skin of a red apple mostly reflects red light. Only the red wavelengths are scattered back outside the apple skin, and the others are absorbed by it.

Energy Conservation

A single photon can only participate in one of the diffuse, subsurface scattering and backlighting components, for physical correctness we do not want more photons leaving the surface than entering. For Standard Surface, it is automatically ensured that the sum of these components is not higher than 1.

Specular Scattering

Specular Roughness 0 to 1

Roughness

The specular layer is modeled using a microfacet distribution. We assume that the surface consists of microscopic faces oriented in random directions. A surface with low roughness such as a mirror will have little variation between the faces, resulting in sharp reflections. With high roughness there will be a lot of variation resulting in softer, glossy reflections.

A strong Specular highlight is visible on the apple. Note the table's specular reflection which is broad and dull (high Specular Roughness value).

To get variation in the highlights of the surface, a map should be connected to the Specular Roughness. This will influence not only the brightness of the highlight but also it's size and the sharpness of the environmental reflection.

Low Specular Roughness

High Specular Roughness

'Scratches' texture connected to Specular Roughness

Transmission

Photons can not only be reflected off the surface, but can refract through it as well. Photons will pass through the specular layer, typically changing direction when exiting on the other side of the layer, controlled by the index of refraction (IOR).

If the interior of the surface is transparent, such as for clear glass, then photons can pass through the object and exit on the other side. If there is a diffuse interior, the photon can scatter inside the object and get absorbed or exit the object again. The more refractive the specular layer, the more the underlying diffuse interior will be visible. For materials like metals, photons refracting through the specular are often immediately absorbed, and so the diffuse interior is not visible.

Fresnel

The percentage of photons reflected or refracted by the specular layer is view dependent. When looking at surfaces head on, most light is refracted, while at grazing angles most light is reflected. This is called the Fresnel effect. The index of refraction controls exactly how this effect varies with the viewing angle.

Variation of a Specular BRDF with respect to the view direction

Opacity and Transmission

Opacity is best understood as a way to model surface geometry using textures. It does not affect how photons interact with the surface, but rather indicates where the surface's geometry is absent and the photons can pass straight through.

Ramp texture connected to the opacity

A typical use for opacity would be a sprite type of effect, such as cutting out the shape of a leaf from a polygon card or making the tips of hair strands transparent. Be warned however that scenes containing many opacity sprites (for example tree leaves) can slow down rendering considerably.

While being sodomized, whipped, bound and raped, O'Brien overheard the globalist elite planning a military coup in the United States and conspiring to usher in the satanic New World Order. (Gardell, 97-98)

On websites, O'Brien claims she was rescued in 1988, which suggests that her daughter Kelly was no more than eight years old when last abused. Phillips stated in a Granada Forum lecture in 1996 that Kelly was in fact institutionalized when she was eight and has been raised in a mental institution.

Although he has since distanced himself from studies in mind control, licensed psychologist Corydon Hammond seems to confirm as credible accounts similar to O'Brien's in a speech he delivered on June 25, 1992 at at the Fourth Annual Eastern Regional Conference on Abuse and Multiple Personality entitled ""Hypnosis in MPD: Ritual Abuse"" [7]. His critics now refer to it as ""The Greenbaum Speech."" Hammond states:

I've treated and been involved with cases who are part of this original mind-control project as well as having their programming on military reservations in many cases. We find a lot of connections with the CIA.

My best guess is that the purpose of it is that they want an army of Manchurian Candidates, tens of thousands of mental robots who will do prostitution, do child pornography, smuggle drugs, engage in international arms smuggling, do snuff films, all sorts of very lucrative things and do their bidding and eventually the megalomaniacs at the top believe they'll create a Satanic Order that will rule the world.""[8]

These and other assertions and observations made in the speech show that Corydon Hammond agrees with O'Brien's contention that governmental mind control programs continue to function. Critics of recovered memories such as the False Memory Syndrome Foundation are quick to add that recovered memories are not accepted without question by mental health professionals. O'Brien has stated that her knowledge of her purported abuse was gained at least partially through accessing recovered memories.[6]

Within the subculture of conspiracy believers, O'Brien has her critics. Writing in his book, Cyberculture Counterconspiracy: A Steamshovel Web Reader, author Kenn Thomas states that conspiracy author Martin Cannon considers both O'Brien and Phillips to be ""frauds"" who are using real details of Project Monarch to ""embellish a dog and pony show"", presumably for financial gain.[1]Mattias Gardell notes that O'Brien's claims are almost entirely unsupported by any evidence outside her testimony or the similarly unverified testimony of others.[9]",Pile-CC,Pcc,"O'Brien made these claims in the TranceFormation of America (1995) and Access Denied: For Reasons of National Security (2004) which she co-authored with Mark Phillips.[6] O'Brien is one of many people publicly claiming to have survived government-sponsored mind control programs.

As a self-described political nerd, Shields considers Margaret Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan to be his surrogate political parents. In school while his classmates were protesting NATOs nuclear missiles based in the U.K., Shields wore a Peace Through Strength button on his uniform.

Shields returned to the U.S. for college and was scheduled to graduate in 1992, but little by little his part-time political work became full time, and he still hasnt finished his degree at GMU. George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove has a similar line on his resume.

In July 1996, Shields moved to Georgia to become communications director for Friends of Newt Gingrich, the then-Speakers campaign operation. Six months later, Shields returned to D.C. to become his national political spokesman and ended up working with Gingrich for five years.

After a very brief foray in the federal work force following the election of Bush, Shields returned to elections work. (I figured out Im a campaign person, a political person, Shields said.)

He moved to Alabama and managed the gubernatorial campaign for Tim James, son of the former governor. James was thumped by Rep. Bob Riley in the June 2002 primary, finishing third with
9 percent.

Then Shields moved north to Pennsylvania to handle press for Rep. George Gekas (R), who was locked in a battle with Democratic Rep. Tim Holden after redistricting threw the two incumbents into the same newly drawn district.

Gekas lost by 2 points but recently called Shields the best-versed operative that I had run into, that was D.C.-based.

Eight years later, Holden is on the extended list of GOP targets that Shields might choose to invest in this fall.

Shields spent two years at the NRCC as research director before applying to be chief of staff for Reichert.

We had all the same values: wanting to serve the country and having the heart of a servant, Reichert said. I offered him the job right there.

Just three months into Reicherts first term, GOP leadership in the House moved to intervene in the Terri Schiavo right-to-die controversy. It was one of [my] first and most important decisions, Reichert said.

According to the Congressman, Shields fostered a healthy debate among the staff and, ultimately, Reichert voted against intervening, putting him at odds with the majority of his party members, who sought to prevent removal of Schiavos feeding tube.

In early 2009, Shields was hired again by the NRCC to be director of special projects. At the time, Democrats were riding high and it looked like Republicans might be headed for a third straight difficult election cycle. Shields resume made him an excellent candidate for the NRCC. Now, the environment has shifted but the Republicans confidence in Shields remains strong.

48,Pcc_pile-val_00048,"A couple of years ago, a mechanical engineer met with Narendra Modi, who would later become India's Prime Minister. The engineer proposed a bold and radical idea that he said would completely change the Indian economy. The idea is called demonetization, and it happened six months ago. The government suddenly declared most of the paper money in circulation worthless. Citizens had a short time to turn in their stashes of cash for new bills. It was an effort to flush out corruption, get people to join the banking system and in the process, help the poor of India.

In part one of this two-part series, we met the man behind demonetization, the engineer, Anil Bokil. Now in part two, we ask, did demonetization work?

Modi had three problems he wanted to solve if the country relied less on cash:

Corruption. Without cash, it's harder to hide money from the taxman. It's also harder to ask for a bribe or run a black market business.

Businesses could be more competitive and grow faster by using banks and electronic payments.

More people would have to use banks, and not keep all their life savings in a drawer. This would keep their money safer.

But, suddenly removing most of the cash in an economy, is very messy. It hurt. Demonetization has affected different people in a variety of a ways. We talked with farmers who don't trust credit cards, small shop owners who had to find new ways to sell their goods, and high tech companies trying to cash in.

Today on the show, we evaluate Modi's demonetization plan ... report card style. How did this shock to a cash-dependent economy play out for a country of a billion people?

This is the second part in our series on India's cash experiment. Last time, we told you the story of the mysterious man who came up with the idea of reducing India's dependence on cash. Today, we talk about how that idea played out in real life.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: India is so addicted to cash that regular people keep piles of it in their houses under the sink, in drawers.

SMITH: Most people don't use banks. They don't have credit cards. Cash is how people save money, little stacks of paper.

VANEK SMITH: So imagine the chaos when India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, got on TV one night and said pretty much all the cash you have is worthless. It was called demonetization.

SMITH: Modi said he was doing this to fight corruption, known around there as black money. Black Money is money that's outside the tax system.

VANEK SMITH: Modi said you have eight weeks to round up all of your old cash and trade it in at the bank for these new bills we've just minted.

SMITH: As you can imagine, in the weeks afterwards, there were giant lines at the banks, panic. But even six months later, people were discovering old money in the bookshelf or something and freaking out.

VANEK SMITH: When I visited New Delhi, you could see people lined up in front of the central bank. The deadline to change old money had passed months ago, and each person there had a story about why they had missed the deadline, like Gurdeep Sagoo. Gurdeep came here today on behalf of his mother. She was sick during the money chaos, and he had this official-looking paper from the doctor.

And so what is it? What does the paper say?

GURDEEP SAGOO: Paper said that she was in a coma.

VANEK SMITH: She was in a coma, so she could not change her money.

SAGOO: Yeah.

SMITH: Fourteen thousand rupees, about $210, his mother's life savings. She had hidden it in her house, but she didn't tell anyone because she was in a coma.

VANEK SMITH: Gurdeep took the day off of work and came to the bank to plead his mother's case, but bank officials said no dice, it's too late. The money is worthless.

How does it feel to look at that money now?

SAGOO: Well, it's blank paper. It's my hard money from my mother.

VANEK SMITH: I mean, how do you feel about all this?

SAGOO: Upset.

VANEK SMITH: Upset. Demonetization caused all kinds of chaos in India. Businesses went bankrupt because nobody had cash to buy anything. People died of heart attacks in the long lines. Some people committed suicide when they realized that they didn't have enough time to change out all their money. About half the country doesn't even use bank accounts.

SMITH: And the government had not prepared for this. They didn't make enough new cash, so parts of India were without money for weeks. And the new cash they printed didn't fit into the old ATMs. As public policy goes, this was a disaster.

VANEK SMITH: And I expected Gurdeep to be really angry at the government for taking away his mother's life savings and for all the trouble this caused but he wasn't.

SAGOO: On the whole, it was a good way.

VANEK SMITH: Really?

SAGOO: Yeah.

VANEK SMITH: Why? OK, why? You have to explain this to me because it doesn't make any sense to me.

SAGOO: Well, black money and other monies that has to be replaced but with the condition that it should not affect the common people.

VANEK SMITH: But it did.

SAGOO: Yeah. It's still affecting.

VANEK SMITH: But you still like it.

SAGOO: Even then. Even then.

VANEK SMITH: Gurdeep was not an exception. Almost everyone I talked to in India told me the same thing. Yes, it's been hard for me. Yes, a lot of people were harmed, but the government did the right thing.

SMITH: Which is striking. I mean, six months ago, the prime minister of India basically dropped a bomb on the economy. Now polls show he's never been more popular. Somehow, this whole thing, it was a hit.

VANEK SMITH: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this economic shock therapy was necessary. It was the only way to solve the country's corruption problem and pull India's economy into the 21st century.

SMITH: Today on the show, six months later, we will give demonetization a report card. Did it work?

(SOUNDBITE OF FLAVIO LEMELLE'S ""CHEEKY TONGUES"")

SMITH: When Prime Minister Modi decided to take away his country's cash, he said this will make India better. And he gave three main reasons for that.

VANEK SMITH: The first reason was corruption because without cash, it is harder to hide money from the tax man. It is also harder to pay a bribe or run a black market. Criminals love cash, so take the cash away, it makes their lives harder.

SMITH: The second reason was the modernization of the Indian economy. Businesses, he said, could be more competitive, could grow faster if they used banks and electronic payments instead of paper.

VANEK SMITH: The third reason was that Modi said regular people would be safer and better off if they were not keeping their life savings in a drawer, if they had access to modern financial help.

SMITH: So that's why Modi made cash scarce in India - eliminated the large bills, put limits on new bills and basically let everyone figure out how to deal with this new cashless society.

VANEK SMITH: So I went to India six months after demonetization had happened to check in on these three goals, to see how India was coming along and see how demonetization was working. My first stop I went to talk to some farmers. Most of the population of India farms these little, tiny plots of land.

Oh, there's a tractor that just pulled out in front of us.

I drove out to Ghaziabad. It's a rural area outside of New Delhi. And here farmers work little half-acre plots all right next to each other. They grow tomatoes and celery and sugarcane. I found about a dozen farmers all standing together under a giant fig tree in the middle of all the fields.

ASSAR PREMI: My name is Assar Premi. My age is 93.

VANEK SMITH: Ninety-three. Assar says he and his friends meet here every morning and every evening.

PREMI: They're my friends. Sit here, discuss everything here.

VANEK SMITH: Really? Do you sit here many evenings?

PREMI: Yes.

VANEK SMITH: What do you talk about?

PREMI: About our relationship, sometimes politics also.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter).

Relationships and politics. Things are hard here. The farmers don't have much land. The crops they raise barely cover their expenses. And everything, all of the business here, it's all done in cash.

SMITH: After Prime Minister Modi said a lot of that cash would be worthless in those first few weeks, farmers had a tough decision to make. I mean, obviously they had to work. They had to tend to their fields. But they also had to do something about their life savings in cash that was about to be rendered worthless.

VANEK SMITH: Garunder Shodi, one of the farmers here under the fig tree, said he and all the farmers he knew had to leave the fields and go get in line at the bank.

GARUNDER SHODI: There were some people who suffered a lot. There were queues since morning 6 o'clock, 5 o'clock, till night, 10 o'clock. There are people, hand-to-mouth people - there are so many poor people.

SMITH: And these are people who could not afford to miss a day's wages standing in line totally panicked. And nobody had money to buy anything. Farmers couldn't sell their crops.

SHODI: The small farmers also suffered. Seventy trucks of tomatoes were thrown on the road by farmers. Because of dismonetization (ph), there was no buyer.

VANEK SMITH: No buyers for the tomatoes. And it's not like farmers can just be patient and wait it out. They have to harvest the food when it's ready. And when there were no buyers they just had to destroy their crops. During this time, farmers saw sales of produce drop in half.

SMITH: I almost feel like the government wanted to punish people for using cash. It was such a pain for everyone in those first few weeks that it almost seems like they were trying to send a message, that hey, look, like, you would be way better off if you just used bank accounts, if you just had a credit card.

VANEK SMITH: But after the lines at the banks got shorter, all the farmers I talked to just went back to using cash, like Harinder Singh, who grows greens and onions and these things.

HARINDER SINGH: (Foreign language spoken).

VANEK SMITH: Oh, eggplants.

SINGH: (Foreign language spoken).

VANEK SMITH: Yes, it's a little guy.

And through a translator, Harinder told me that he is just too old to start trying to pay for things in a new way.

SINGH: (Through interpreter) Cash is something I understand, so I would rather deal with cash. I don't understand these other things, so I'm happy with cash.

VANEK SMITH: Harinder said to him, credit cards seemed dangerous, like someone could steal the number and use it. He wasn't exactly sure how they worked and it kind of freaked him out. He wants to stick with cash.

SMITH: So we're going to try and grade how Modi's done on his objectives. And so one of the reasons for demonetization was to improve the lot of regular people in India, to improve the lot of farmers. I'm going to call this grade an incomplete because it seems like things were very bad and then went back to normal, mostly. People are still using cash.

VANEK SMITH: Right. Nothing really changed, although the government has claimed that millions of people opened bank accounts in rural areas. From everything that I've seen and read, incomplete sounds about right.

SMITH: OK, next up?

VANEK SMITH: The suburbs of New Delhi, which were actually not too far from the fields. You could actually see a lot of the high-rises from the eggplant patch. And when you drive through them, it's really striking because it's all these, like, nice kind of high-rise buildings and they're all vacant.

Empty building. Empty building.

I wanted to see these buildings because they have become, like, a symbol of corruption in India. One of the main reasons Modi gave for demonetization was to fight corruption, black money. And Modi and his advisers felt like corruption was siphoning off the economic success of his country. Now, there are a lot of ways to hide cash in India, but these apartment buildings, this is where most of the black money in India was stored.

AKHILESH TILOTIA: But real estate, of course, is the big gorilla.

VANEK SMITH: Akhilesh Tilotia is the author of ""The Making Of India."" He says in fact, high rises like these are where most of the black money in India is stored, something like 25 percent of the country's GDP.

SMITH: So here's how it works. Say you want to buy an apartment and the price is $125,000. Well, officially, you only pay $100,000. The extra $25,000 you slip to the owner in cash. Nobody talks about it. It doesn't get taxed.

VANEK SMITH: So as the owner, you get $25,000 in untaxed money under the table, which is great. And as the buyer, you count on being able to do that same thing when you sell your apartment someday. But when Modi rolled out his demonetization plan that whole system just kind of shut down.

TILOTIA: I am stuck. If you were sitting with an inventory of cash that becomes exposed, and suddenly that black money has disappeared because now you can't transact that house at a higher amount. You will find that builders are willing to offer anywhere between 10 to 30, 40 percent discounts.

VANEK SMITH: That's a lot. That's a lot.

TILOTIA: Yes. And so that has had a rather terrible shock for people who were hiding or putting away their black money in some of these places.

SMITH: I mean, it is bad for the economy. Although from the government's point of view I can see how they might consider this a success, you know, thwarting this big pool of black money. And eventually prices will adjust and things will return back to normal but without the whole kickback part.

VANEK SMITH: That is true. But it is still hard to know whether the actual goal of getting rid of corruption in India has been successful. I mean, the government was hoping that tax evaders and criminals would be stuck with these huge stacks of cash that they wouldn't have time to turn in, or when they turned them in the bank would suddenly see that they had all this cash that they hadn't been taxed on.

SMITH: In other words, they would learn that crime does not pay.

VANEK SMITH: They would learn that crime does not pay. But Bhaskar Chakravorti, an economist at Tufts University, says even after all that drama almost all of the cash in circulation in India still made its way back into the banking system.

BHASKAR CHAKRAVORTI: Not all of that was legal cash. It just happened to be the case that India has - is extremely innovative in getting it on constraints.

SMITH: Innovative.

VANEK SMITH: Innovative. For instance, I talked to one banker who told me that he'd seen a bunch of his colleagues at the bank taking huge amounts of cash from rich clients and just changing it into new bills for a little fee. There were also stories of rich families asking their maids and drivers and cooks to stand in line for them and change out their cash.

VANEK SMITH: Yeah. That feels right. And that's not terrible for six months later.

SMITH: Not bad. Yeah, it is a long-term problem. Our next and final stop is a market in the city of New Delhi, where we will meet people who actually are making the best of a cashless economy after this.

(SOUNDBITE OF HARLIN JAMES AND PAUL LEWIS' ""YADA YADA"")

VANEK SMITH: For my final stop, I wanted to see how things had changed for the urban middle class in India. Remember, Modi believed that getting rid of large amounts of cash would help India move into the 21st century. Businesses, he said, could be more competitive and grow faster using banks and electronic payments. So I went right into the heart of New Delhi to this market to see what people there would tell me. Rawinda Bhardwaj is 66 and he owns a pharmacy stall in the market.

RAWINDA BHARDWAJ: I'm running my pharmacy shop here since the last 35 years.

VANEK SMITH: Yeah, you have a lot of prescriptions, I'm seeing, all the way up to the ceiling.

This market was in a very middle-class neighborhood. It was a nice market. But even still, almost all of the businesses had only taken cash, including Rawinda. He was a cash man. He didn't like credit cards, didn't really understand how they worked. Mobile payments were totally out of the question for him.

SMITH: But then demonetization happened. And in the weeks afterwards, you know, Rawinda's customers still needed their prescriptions, their medicine, and cash was no longer an option for him.

VANEK SMITH: So Rawinda made himself figure it out. He started taking credit cards, and he even signed up for this mobile payment service called Paytm where people could pay for their prescriptions on their mobile phones.

Has it been good for business to take the cards?

BHARDWAJ: It's very good for business.

VANEK SMITH: Now, six months later, about half of Rawinda's customers pay with Paytm or credit card. And he says they even buy a little bit more than they used do.

Oh, these are your receipts.

BHARDWAJ: Yes, receipts. This is all by credit card, by Paytm, by debit card, by check.

VANEK SMITH: Rawinda now checks his deposits on his phone. He no longer has to walk to the bank with cash deposit every day. And he loves this. He's become such a convert that, in fact, he has stopped using cash himself.

BHARDWAJ: My personal, all credit card.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, you don't use cash anymore?

BHARDWAJ: No, no, no, no need of cash - credit card.

VANEK SMITH: Most of the stores in the market now take credit cards, and all the stores in the market take mobile payments from this company called Paytm. In fact, everywhere I went in India everybody was talking about Paytm and how big they'd gotten since demonetization. So I thought I would go check out the company.

Oh, Paytm. Here we are.

For Paytm, demonetization was like the greatest gift ever because when the government got rid of most of the cash in the country, it didn't really offer an alternative. Madhur Deora is the CFO of Paytm. And he said when Modi made his announcement, the company knew this was their moment.

MADHUR DEORA: Then we sort of jumped into action. So we had front-page ads in the next day's newspapers.

VANEK SMITH: Paytm wasn't exactly a household name, and so a lot of the ads were just like, hey, we are here. You can pay for stuff with us. Other ads were these kind of DIY instructions to businesses and employers, basically, explaining as simply and clearly as possible how to use the Paytm phone app, even how mobile payments worked.

DEORA: One of the ads that we did we feel quite proud off. A quarter of that page was a cut out. So merchants could literally cut a quarter of that ad and just put that up and just fill in their name and their mobile number that they could put on the wall.

VANEK SMITH: Once their name and their mobile number was on the wall, customers could use that information to pay them through the Paytm app. It was very simple. And businesses were desperate to do this. They were all signing up - little roadside vegetable stands, hardware stores, taxis - even temples started letting people leave offerings with Paytm.

SMITH: Now, I know India is a big country, but the growth rates that Paytm was seeing was pretty amazing. Half a million people were signing up every day. A hundred and twenty million Indians now use Paytm.

VANEK SMITH: And for the government, this is also good news because, unlike cash, Paytm transactions are trackable. They are taxable. Between the credit cards and the mobile apps, it was like this whole unseen part of the economy was suddenly out in the light.

SMITH: So if you look specifically at the part of the Indian economy that was sort of on the verge of moving away from cash, anyway - if you look at them - the people we're talking about here - I mean, I'd give the grade satisfactory.

VANEK SMITH: Yeah, satisfactory, for sure.

SMITH: And as we talked about at the beginning, Modi does deserve some extra credit because, I've got to say, I've never seen a political official who changed an economy overnight, and people still approved of him. People still forgave him for what he did.

VANEK SMITH: And it wasn't just a question of forgiveness. This move actually made Modi more popular. His approval ratings are now at 69 percent, which is incredible for a politician. And almost everyone I talked to in India supported Modi's demonetization plan, even people who'd really suffered because of it - actually, especially people who'd really suffered because of it.

And when I asked them why, a lot of them told me that they stand in long lines all the time and deal with frustrating bureaucracy all the time. But all of a sudden, they're standing in line for a reason - to thwart corruption, to punish tax evaders. All of a sudden, standing in line and going through all this bureaucracy had a patriotic purpose.

SMITH: You know, this explains a lot. When I was listening to the last episode, which was about Anil Bokil - he's the architect of this whole plan - he had this strange moment with you when he was talking about demonetization in an almost religious way.

SMITH: And now I kind of understand it. Enlightenment means finding sort of a greater meaning and purpose in even the difficult things in life, and that's essentially what India is doing right now.

VANEK SMITH: Yes. And I heard this from a lot of people, including Gurdeep Sagoo, the man whose mother lost her life savings because she went into a coma at the wrong moment. He was standing there with his mother's worthless cash in his hand, and he said he was just so fed up and so frustrated with all the corruption in his country. And it finally felt like things were changing, like Modi was fixing it. I asked him what he was going to do with all the old bills that had belonged to his mom.

SAGOO: Maybe I'll put a frame. This was 1,000 rupees. No, these are 500 rupees.

VANEK SMITH: You'll frame it?

SAGOO: Maybe for my next generation.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, so that your family can see what the old...

SAGOO: Yeah, for family, just for the sake of showing of the people.

VANEK SMITH: Just for the sake of showing the people. Like, here it is. Here is a token of the sacrifice we all made for the country - that we all made to make a stronger India.

VANEK SMITH: We love to hear what you think of the show. You can email us planetmoney@npr.org or find us on Facebook or Twitter.

VANEK SMITH: Today's episode was produced by Elizabeth Kulas. PLANET MONEY is edited by Bryant Urstadt and produced by Alex Goldmark.",Pile-CC,Pcc,"A couple of years ago, a mechanical engineer met with Narendra Modi, who would later become India's Prime Minister. The engineer proposed a bold and radical idea that he said would completely change the Indian economy. The idea is called demonetization, and it happened six months ago. The government suddenly declared most of the paper money in circulation worthless. Citizens had a short time to turn in their stashes of cash for new bills. It was an effort to flush out corruption, get people to join the banking system and in the process, help the poor of India.

In part one of this two-part series, we met the man behind demonetization, the engineer, Anil Bokil. Now in part two, we ask, did demonetization work?

Modi had three problems he wanted to solve if the country relied less on cash:

Corruption. Without cash, it's harder to hide money from the taxman. It's also harder to ask for a bribe or run a black market business.

Businesses could be more competitive and grow faster by using banks and electronic payments.

More people would have to use banks, and not keep all their life savings in a drawer. This would keep their money safer.

But, suddenly removing most of the cash in an economy, is very messy. It hurt. Demonetization has affected different people in a variety of a ways. We talked with farmers who don't trust credit cards, small shop owners who had to find new ways to sell their goods, and high tech companies trying to cash in.

Today on the show, we evaluate Modi's demonetization plan ... report card style. How did this shock to a cash-dependent economy play out for a country of a billion people?

This is the second part in our series on India's cash experiment. Last time, we told you the story of the mysterious man who came up with the idea of reducing India's dependence on cash. Today, we talk about how that idea played out in real life.

STACEY VANEK SMITH, BYLINE: India is so addicted to cash that regular people keep piles of it in their houses under the sink, in drawers.

SMITH: Most people don't use banks. They don't have credit cards. Cash is how people save money, little stacks of paper.

VANEK SMITH: So imagine the chaos when India's prime minister, Narendra Modi, got on TV one night and said pretty much all the cash you have is worthless. It was called demonetization.

SMITH: Modi said he was doing this to fight corruption, known around there as black money. Black Money is money that's outside the tax system.

VANEK SMITH: Modi said you have eight weeks to round up all of your old cash and trade it in at the bank for these new bills we've just minted.

SMITH: As you can imagine, in the weeks afterwards, there were giant lines at the banks, panic. But even six months later, people were discovering old money in the bookshelf or something and freaking out.

VANEK SMITH: When I visited New Delhi, you could see people lined up in front of the central bank. The deadline to change old money had passed months ago, and each person there had a story about why they had missed the deadline, like Gurdeep Sagoo. Gurdeep came here today on behalf of his mother. She was sick during the money chaos, and he had this official-looking paper from the doctor.

And so what is it? What does the paper say?

GURDEEP SAGOO: Paper said that she was in a coma.

VANEK SMITH: She was in a coma, so she could not change her money.

SAGOO: Yeah.

SMITH: Fourteen thousand rupees, about $210, his mother's life savings. She had hidden it in her house, but she didn't tell anyone because she was in a coma.

VANEK SMITH: Gurdeep took the day off of work and came to the bank to plead his mother's case, but bank officials said no dice, it's too late. The money is worthless.

How does it feel to look at that money now?

SAGOO: Well, it's blank paper. It's my hard money from my mother.

VANEK SMITH: I mean, how do you feel about all this?

SAGOO: Upset.

VANEK SMITH: Upset. Demonetization caused all kinds of chaos in India. Businesses went bankrupt because nobody had cash to buy anything. People died of heart attacks in the long lines. Some people committed suicide when they realized that they didn't have enough time to change out all their money. About half the country doesn't even use bank accounts.

SMITH: And the government had not prepared for this. They didn't make enough new cash, so parts of India were without money for weeks. And the new cash they printed didn't fit into the old ATMs. As public policy goes, this was a disaster.

VANEK SMITH: And I expected Gurdeep to be really angry at the government for taking away his mother's life savings and for all the trouble this caused but he wasn't.

SAGOO: On the whole, it was a good way.

VANEK SMITH: Really?

SAGOO: Yeah.

VANEK SMITH: Why? OK, why? You have to explain this to me because it doesn't make any sense to me.

SAGOO: Well, black money and other monies that has to be replaced but with the condition that it should not affect the common people.

VANEK SMITH: But it did.

SAGOO: Yeah. It's still affecting.

VANEK SMITH: But you still like it.

SAGOO: Even then. Even then.

VANEK SMITH: Gurdeep was not an exception. Almost everyone I talked to in India told me the same thing. Yes, it's been hard for me. Yes, a lot of people were harmed, but the government did the right thing.

SMITH: Which is striking. I mean, six months ago, the prime minister of India basically dropped a bomb on the economy. Now polls show he's never been more popular. Somehow, this whole thing, it was a hit.

VANEK SMITH: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said this economic shock therapy was necessary. It was the only way to solve the country's corruption problem and pull India's economy into the 21st century.

SMITH: Today on the show, six months later, we will give demonetization a report card. Did it work?

(SOUNDBITE OF FLAVIO LEMELLE'S ""CHEEKY TONGUES"")

SMITH: When Prime Minister Modi decided to take away his country's cash, he said this will make India better. And he gave three main reasons for that.

VANEK SMITH: The first reason was corruption because without cash, it is harder to hide money from the tax man. It is also harder to pay a bribe or run a black market. Criminals love cash, so take the cash away, it makes their lives harder.

SMITH: The second reason was the modernization of the Indian economy. Businesses, he said, could be more competitive, could grow faster if they used banks and electronic payments instead of paper.

VANEK SMITH: The third reason was that Modi said regular people would be safer and better off if they were not keeping their life savings in a drawer, if they had access to modern financial help.

SMITH: So that's why Modi made cash scarce in India - eliminated the large bills, put limits on new bills and basically let everyone figure out how to deal with this new cashless society.

VANEK SMITH: So I went to India six months after demonetization had happened to check in on these three goals, to see how India was coming along and see how demonetization was working. My first stop I went to talk to some farmers. Most of the population of India farms these little, tiny plots of land.

Oh, there's a tractor that just pulled out in front of us.

I drove out to Ghaziabad. It's a rural area outside of New Delhi. And here farmers work little half-acre plots all right next to each other. They grow tomatoes and celery and sugarcane. I found about a dozen farmers all standing together under a giant fig tree in the middle of all the fields.

ASSAR PREMI: My name is Assar Premi. My age is 93.

VANEK SMITH: Ninety-three. Assar says he and his friends meet here every morning and every evening.

PREMI: They're my friends. Sit here, discuss everything here.

VANEK SMITH: Really? Do you sit here many evenings?

PREMI: Yes.

VANEK SMITH: What do you talk about?

PREMI: About our relationship, sometimes politics also.

VANEK SMITH: (Laughter).

Relationships and politics. Things are hard here. The farmers don't have much land. The crops they raise barely cover their expenses. And everything, all of the business here, it's all done in cash.

SMITH: After Prime Minister Modi said a lot of that cash would be worthless in those first few weeks, farmers had a tough decision to make. I mean, obviously they had to work. They had to tend to their fields. But they also had to do something about their life savings in cash that was about to be rendered worthless.

VANEK SMITH: Garunder Shodi, one of the farmers here under the fig tree, said he and all the farmers he knew had to leave the fields and go get in line at the bank.

GARUNDER SHODI: There were some people who suffered a lot. There were queues since morning 6 o'clock, 5 o'clock, till night, 10 o'clock. There are people, hand-to-mouth people - there are so many poor people.

SMITH: And these are people who could not afford to miss a day's wages standing in line totally panicked. And nobody had money to buy anything. Farmers couldn't sell their crops.

SHODI: The small farmers also suffered. Seventy trucks of tomatoes were thrown on the road by farmers. Because of dismonetization (ph), there was no buyer.

VANEK SMITH: No buyers for the tomatoes. And it's not like farmers can just be patient and wait it out. They have to harvest the food when it's ready. And when there were no buyers they just had to destroy their crops. During this time, farmers saw sales of produce drop in half.

SMITH: I almost feel like the government wanted to punish people for using cash. It was such a pain for everyone in those first few weeks that it almost seems like they were trying to send a message, that hey, look, like, you would be way better off if you just used bank accounts, if you just had a credit card.

VANEK SMITH: But after the lines at the banks got shorter, all the farmers I talked to just went back to using cash, like Harinder Singh, who grows greens and onions and these things.

HARINDER SINGH: (Foreign language spoken).

VANEK SMITH: Oh, eggplants.

SINGH: (Foreign language spoken).

VANEK SMITH: Yes, it's a little guy.

And through a translator, Harinder told me that he is just too old to start trying to pay for things in a new way.

SINGH: (Through interpreter) Cash is something I understand, so I would rather deal with cash. I don't understand these other things, so I'm happy with cash.

VANEK SMITH: Harinder said to him, credit cards seemed dangerous, like someone could steal the number and use it. He wasn't exactly sure how they worked and it kind of freaked him out. He wants to stick with cash.

SMITH: So we're going to try and grade how Modi's done on his objectives. And so one of the reasons for demonetization was to improve the lot of regular people in India, to improve the lot of farmers. I'm going to call this grade an incomplete because it seems like things were very bad and then went back to normal, mostly. People are still using cash.

VANEK SMITH: Right. Nothing really changed, although the government has claimed that millions of people opened bank accounts in rural areas. From everything that I've seen and read, incomplete sounds about right.

SMITH: OK, next up?

VANEK SMITH: The suburbs of New Delhi, which were actually not too far from the fields. You could actually see a lot of the high-rises from the eggplant patch. And when you drive through them, it's really striking because it's all these, like, nice kind of high-rise buildings and they're all vacant.

Empty building. Empty building.

I wanted to see these buildings because they have become, like, a symbol of corruption in India. One of the main reasons Modi gave for demonetization was to fight corruption, black money. And Modi and his advisers felt like corruption was siphoning off the economic success of his country.

VANEK SMITH: Akhilesh Tilotia is the author of ""The Making Of India."" He says in fact, high rises like these are where most of the black money in India is stored, something like 25 percent of the country's GDP.

SMITH: So here's how it works. Say you want to buy an apartment and the price is $125,000. Well, officially, you only pay $100,000. The extra $25,000 you slip to the owner in cash. Nobody talks about it. It doesn't get taxed.

VANEK SMITH: So as the owner, you get $25,000 in untaxed money under the table, which is great. And as the buyer, you count on being able to do that same thing when you sell your apartment someday. But when Modi rolled out his demonetization plan that whole system just kind of shut down.

TILOTIA: I am stuck. If you were sitting with an inventory of cash that becomes exposed, and suddenly that black money has disappeared because now you can't transact that house at a higher amount. You will find that builders are willing to offer anywhere between 10 to 30, 40 percent discounts.

VANEK SMITH: That's a lot. That's a lot.

TILOTIA: Yes. And so that has had a rather terrible shock for people who were hiding or putting away their black money in some of these places.

VANEK SMITH: Yes. And I heard this from a lot of people, including Gurdeep Sagoo, the man whose mother lost her life savings because she went into a coma at the wrong moment. He was standing there with his mother's worthless cash in his hand, and he said he was just so fed up and so frustrated with all the corruption in his country. And it finally felt like things were changing, like Modi was fixing it. I asked him what he was going to do with all the old bills that had belonged to his mom.

SAGOO: Maybe I'll put a frame. This was 1,000 rupees. No, these are 500 rupees.

VANEK SMITH: You'll frame it?

SAGOO: Maybe for my next generation.

VANEK SMITH: Oh, so that your family can see what the old...

SAGOO: Yeah, for family, just for the sake of showing of the people.

VANEK SMITH: Just for the sake of showing the people. Like, here it is. Here is a token of the sacrifice we all made for the country - that we all made to make a stronger India.
