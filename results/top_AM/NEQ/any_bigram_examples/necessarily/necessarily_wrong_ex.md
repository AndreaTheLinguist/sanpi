| **`pcc_eng_15_046.7655_x0739911_056:13-14-15`** | I 'm often reminded that strength , adventure , or power are not __`necessarily wrong`__ in and of themselves .                                                                           |
| **`pcc_eng_22_082.6116_x1319190_32:13-14-15`**  | That 's just the nature of the beast , and there 's nothing __`necessarily wrong`__ with that .                                                                                           |
