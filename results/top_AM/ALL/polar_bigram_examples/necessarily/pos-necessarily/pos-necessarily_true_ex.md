| **`pcc_eng_19_043.5011_x0686149_2:13-14`**  | Specific sense in logic , differentiating what is possible from what is __``necessarily true``__ , is from 1610s .                                                           |
| **`pcc_eng_10_014.8546_x0223818_13:5-6`**   | Is what I say __``necessarily true``__ or accurate ?                                                                                                                         |
| **`pcc_eng_01_058.1117_x0923549_049:8-9`**  | In my scheme , that is only __``necessarily true``__ of secular space .                                                                                                      |
| **`pcc_eng_18_046.7608_x0740619_3:5-6`**    | But is that always __``necessarily true``__ ?                                                                                                                                |
| **`pcc_eng_06_089.7886_x1435942_159:7-8`**  | So premiss ( 1 ) seems __``necessarily true``__ .                                                                                                                            |
| **`pcc_eng_20_002.9164_x0030683_5:11-12`**  | On our view , intuitions like the Gettier intuition are __``necessarily true``__ and knowable a priori .                                                                     |
| **`pcc_eng_07_096.1083_x1537168_20:17-18`** | Consequently , since the truthmakers for every true proposition exist necessarily , every true proposition is __``necessarily true``__ .                                     |
| **`pcc_eng_05_037.8342_x0596462_29:30-31`** | Many of our beliefs are what Haidt ( The Righteous Mind : Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion ) terms ' groupish ' , rather than __``necessarily true``__ . |
